this game if you like playing games like rise of kingdoms on mobile phone this game is almost like rise of kingdom exactly but they were a little bit more innovative in terms of some base content and best part its on pc but it feels like a phone game to be really honest what this game need to improve are hotkeys hotkeys are almost not present in this game which is really annoying as you have to click using your mouse to do everything so i really hope in the future it will add more hotkeys so that playing the game feels more easier and using the keyboard way more more rather than the mouse since its a pc game not a mobile game the only hotkey i found in this game was esc which when you press it it will ask you whether you want to exit the game or not warnings this game have an economy called gems which is to buy speedups and some other good stuff but its quite hard to get but its earnable so sometimes its really annoying is that if you accidentally press something that require gems and it does not give you a single warning to confirm that purchase so rip gems that you have been saving i really hope they add a confirmation button so that we dont mistakenly press and feel depressed about it optimization within the city it feels alright for the most part and pretty smooth i would say the problem that i find was that the layout mode its very hard to arrange your things nicely and in order because the grid that they provide is hardly accurate so i hope it will be more accurate in the next few updates so that arranging things would be much easier  now outside of the city i dont like the path of our troops  when we set them out as they cant go sideways but only left right straight or backwards which is pretty old school and doesnt really feel good at all one more thing that i must emphasis on is the zoom in and out key i wish that you could add the feature that we can use our mouses scroll wheel to zoom in and out this is really annoying because i always have to use my touch pad on my laptop and the sensitivity is very low i also hope you could let us zoom out into our field and the world easier so dont have to tap the button always to go out of our city i also suggest adding more settings options to make game play experience better and suit our liking as the settings we ahve right now is very limited graphics okay graphic wise withing the city can be better but its already great enough and im satisfied enough with the graphics within the city only but when you go outside of the city i feel that the objects are a bit oversize and does not look very good i do hope you improve on it your character graphics are spot on 5star for it but when we set them out they dont look really great and the troops they are leading are very plain and look very unmotivated needs improvement on that as well and hope the characters look as good as the picture showsthe world map feels like its 2d but i hope itll become 3d  so its much much much nicer animations this is the worst part i would say the animations its either its ugly or none at all i hope in the future you would make better animations especially on our character skills the movement of our troops feels very awkward as well maybe because they are really oversize on the map i hope more effect will be added on to the game so that the game feels much more exiting and makes me want to play even more i understand it was a mobile game before but now your trying to port over to pc which i will give my full support on because ive been waiting for this kind of game on this pc for the longest time but i would suggest making a whole different feel because pc can handle and use more ram than phone even phone nowadays can handle as much ram as a pc can so i dont see why not upgrade the graphics and animation to a whole new level tutorials tutorial feel like a job that was in a rush the explanation was not very clear and a misclick could end up missing a chat bubble which is required to understand it better i hope more clearer explanation and guidance is put into the game so more players can experience  a wonderful time extras overall a pretty good game i do really hope and wish that this game will become something like rise of kingdom which have good graphics good animation good optimization nice feel nice mechanics and and most importantly great content i dont know what will this game become in the future but i will be playing till it becomes one of the games that i have ever played i do suggest rebuilding it on unreal engine 5 to make it better graphically and better optimize do advertise this game as well because i think its need a lot more populations but its still on early access so i dont blame developers on anything hope you guys keep up the good work and focus more resources on this game because i personally think itll be a great game,6.4,i am cfj,6,TRUE,FALSE
