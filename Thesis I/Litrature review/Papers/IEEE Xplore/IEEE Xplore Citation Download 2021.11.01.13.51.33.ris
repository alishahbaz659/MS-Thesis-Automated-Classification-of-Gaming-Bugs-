AB  - Software and its development generates an inordinate amount of data. Development activities such as check-ins, work items, bug reports, code reviews, and test executions are recorded in software repositories. User interactions that reflect how customers experience software are recorded in telemetry data, run-time traces, and log files and helps to track application and feature usage and expose performance and reliability. Software analytics takes this data and turns it into actionable insight to better inform decisions related to software. In this talk, I will summarize our efforts in the area of software analytics with a special focus on digital games. I will present several examples of games studies, which we have worked on at Microsoft Research such as how players are engaged in Project Gotham Racing, how skill develops over time in Halo Reach and Forza Motor sports, and the initial experience of game play. I will also point out important differences between games development and traditional software development. The work presented in this talk has been done by Nachi Nagappan, myself, and many others who have visited our group over the past years.

AB  - General game testing relies on the use of human play testers, play test scripting, and prior knowledge of areas of interest to produce relevant test data. Using deep reinforcement learning (DRL), we introduce a self-learning mechanism to the game testing framework. With DRL, the framework is capable of exploring and/or exploiting the game mechanics based on a user-defined, reinforcing reward signal. As a result, test coverage is increased and unintended game play mechanics, exploits and bugs are discovered in a multitude of game types. In this paper, we show that DRL can be used to increase test coverage, find exploits, test map difficulty, and to detect common problems that arise in the testing of first-person shooter (FPS) games.

AB  - Video game is a very lucrative industry, unleashed by the ubiquity of gaming devices, multi-player networks and live broadcasting platforms. Games generate large amounts of behavioural data which are valuable to face the new challenges of video game analytics such as detecting balance issues, bugs and cheaters. In electronic sports (e-sports), cyberathletes conceal their online training using different aliases or avatars (virtual identities), which allow them not being recognized by the opponents they may face in future competitions (with cash prices challenging already most of the traditional sports). It was recently suggested that behavioural data generated by the games allows predicting the avatar associated to a game play with high accuracy. However, when a player uses several avatars, accuracy drastically drops as prediction models cannot easily differentiate the player's different avatar aliases. Since mappings between players and avatars do not exist, we introduce the avatar aliases identification problem and propose an original approach for alias resolution based on supervised classification and Formal Concept Analysis. We thoroughly evaluate our method with the video game Starcraft 2 which has a very wide and active community with players from diverse cultures and nations. We show that under some circumstances, the avatars of a given player can easily be recognized as such. These results are valuable for e-sport structures (to help preparing tournaments), and game editors (detecting cheaters or usurpers).

AB  - Game design and development activities are increasingly relying on the analysis of gamer's behavior and preferences data. Various tools are available to the developers to track and analyze general data concerning acquisition, retention and monetization aspects of game commercialization. This is good enough to give hints on where problems are, but not to enable a precise diagnosis, which demands fine-grained data. For this kind of data, there is not enough support or guidance to decide which data to capture, to write the code to capture it, to choose the best representation of it and to allow an adequate retrieval and presentation of it. This paper introduces GameGuts (GG), a framework devoted to give further assistance to developers in choosing, representing, accessing and presenting game sessions fine-grained data. As a case study, GG recorded sessions of a game platform with over a hundred thousand users. The logs were analyzed using a Visual Domain Specific Language (as a query language) and an ensemble of rules (as a compliance test). The results are encouraging, since we could - among other results - find bugs and catch cheaters, as well as spot design flaws.

AB  - While traditional software patches primarily fix bugs, modern online computer games use patches to change gameplay, as well. Despite the importance of gameplay changes for both game players and game designers, to the best of our knowledge, there are no published results nor available 3rd party Websites that analyze game data and patch data. We analyzed the effects of patches on gameplay in League of Legends (LoL), a popular online game created by Riot Games. Our methods: a) harvested all available patch data - over 160 patches with over 7700 changes - classifying patches based on a novel taxonomy; b) gathered game statistics from over 11,000 players in over 465,000 games; and c) analyzed both the patch data and game data, with emphasis on correlations. In addition, we developed a publicly accessible Web site that allows for interactive exploration of the game data and patch data. Analysis of the data shows that Riot patches LoL gameplay an average of twice each day, about ten times more often than Riot patches LoL bugs. Patches tend to keep all player-chosen champions close to a win rate of 50%. While most patch gameplay changes can be categorized and even quantified numerically, the impact of combined changes are not always straightforward and interpretation of patch text is required in order to understand the full impact.

We develop State-State Siamese Networks (S3N) as an efficient deep metric learning approach to AD in this context and explore how it may be used as part of an automated testing tool. Finally, we show by empirical evaluation on a series of Atari games, that S3N is able to learn a meaningful embedding, and consequently is able to identify various common types of video game bugs.

AB  - Protection of smart grids against cyber attacks has become one of the nation's top priorities. Most existing approaches have focused on intrusion detection and post-attack responses in a similar fashion to fault detection and recovery. However, attack behaviors are much more complex and less predictable than fault behaviors as an attacker often changes his course of actions during the attacks. Thus, there is a need for a systematic approach that can incorporate behaviors of attackers into the decision analysis of security management. This is especially crucial as attackers can keep advancing their techniques to outsmart security technologies. Our research aims to enhance the science of security that enables behavioral modeling as well as model extensibility. In particular, we present an analytical game theoretic approach to analyzing security of smart grid SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition) systems by including attacker/defender behaviors in the proposed sequential, non-zero sum, and two-player game model. The paper describes the development of the game payoffs and illustrates how informed decisions can be made on a real-world scenario of attacks at the sensor level of the smart grid SCADA systems.

AB  - The fundamental problem which corporate governance is committed to addressing between different ownership structures is different. This paper studies the expropriation problems resulted from concentration of ownership. Analyzing this problem with traditional game theory has some defects because of entirely rationality is a high requirement which is difficult to meet for the general decision makers. When the social economic environment and the decision problems are complicated, bounded rationality of people is very obvious. In the paper, it analyzes the evolutionary stability strategies and the replicator dynamics between controlling shareholders and minority shareholders. We confirms that cutting the minority shareholders' monitoring costs and the controlling shareholders' expropriation benefits will promote the company to improve internal governance.

AB  - On the basis of the bidding model of the lowest-price sealed bid and given the material quality and delivery schedule, this paper offers an analysis of the low price tender in the market of grid materials purchasing using incomplete information game theory. As the quality of materials from successful bidders cannot be fully recognized by grid companies, the low price winning suppliers, driven by interests, will run the risk of cheating on workmanship and materials, thus giving rise to adverse selection in the market of grid materials purchasing. The principal-agent model can generate the mechanism that overcomes the defects of low price tender system and the optimal bid invitation plan: the market supervisory organ is introduced as the third party independently participating in the game; the hierarchical evaluation mechanism for material suppliers is established through repeated game to advance the sound development of material purchase market.

AB  - Software crowd sourcing platforms such as TopCoder have successfully adopted the offense-defense based quality assurance mechanism into software development process to deliver high-quality software solutions. TopCoder algorithm contests run single-round matches (SRM) with the challenge phase that allows participants to find bugs in the submitted program and eliminate their opponents. In the paper, we introduce a game theoretic model to study the competitive behaviors in the challenge phase of SRM. By analyzing the Nash Equilibrium of our multiple-person game model, we find that the probability of making a successful challenge and effort cost are the major factors for contestants' decisions. To verify the theoretic result, we make empirical data analysis with the dataset collected from the algorithm challenge phase on TopCoder. And the results indicate that contestants with a high rating are more likely to launch challenges against lower ones. However, contestants with the highest rating may be unwilling to challenge to avoid risks of losing their points in the contests.

AB  - Bugs that persist into releases of video games can have negative impacts on both developers and users, but particular aspects of testing in game development can lead to difficulties in effectively catching these missed bugs. It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types. Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from greater attention in order to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our results in devising tools and methods to better identify and address certain bug types.

A proper analysis of the feedback collected from the players will allow the developers to identify crucial features requested by the players as well as bugs and imbalances present in a video game. In the past, various approaches have been taken by researchers to create a solution to analyze the vast amount of player feedback available publicly such as on review platforms. The various approaches taken, and their findings are neither very clear nor properly documented considering the variations present in them. If the limitations and the findings of the existing work are properly analyzed and documented, it will assist in future researches in this domain. This paper presents an analysis of the existing work related to development centric video game player feedback analysis and is a result of ongoing research, by the end of this research we plan on implementing the various approaches explored and overcoming the limitations identified in this paper.

AB  - The advancement of mobile technologies allows developers to build more sophisticated application specifically mobile game. As the result, mobile game has more complex gameplays and incorporates more complex resources, such as 2D images, 3D objects, artificial intelligence, sounds, and many more. Developers are spoilt by the vast number of available game engines that enable rapid mobile game development. However, the mobile game source codes that orchestrate all the interconnected resources are also getting large in the size and eventually leading to difficulties in tracing bugs in the codes. Meanwhile, software testing is still a growing area that, despite vary proposed techniques to identify errors in source code have been developed, yet it has to consider more studies in mobile game category. This research aims to conduct an appropriate testing on a mobile game application. We choose to test an awards-winning mobile game using an available testing tool, named Unity Test Tool. The tool is explored during this study and then applied to test the game that of puzzle genre. At the end of the study, the research finds that the game is faults/bugs-free.

AB  - In this paper, we study the effects of several Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) modifications for video game testing. Although MCTS modifications are highly studied in game playing, their impacts on finding bugs are blank. We focused on bug finding in our previous study where we introduced synthetic and human-like test goals and we used these test goals in Sarsa and MCTS agents to find bugs. In this study, we extend the MCTS agent with several modifications for game testing purposes. Furthermore, we present a novel tree reuse strategy. We experiment with these modifications by testing them on three testbed games, four levels each, that contain 45 bugs in total. We use the General Video Game Artificial Intelligence (GVG-AI) framework to create the testbed games and collect 427 human tester trajectories using the GVG-AI framework. We analyze the proposed modifications in three parts: we evaluate their effects on bug finding performances of agents, we measure their success under two different computational budgets, and we assess their effects on human-likeness of the human-like agent. Our results show that MCTS modifications improve the bug finding performance of the agents.

AB  - In the modern era, online games are still popular with all groups. But over time and game updates, sometimes the quality of online games decreases. This is because the motivation of the player's decreases, the facilities provided are not very helpful, many bugs and cheaters appear in online games. Therefore, a quality model is needed that can analyze every aspect related to the online game. Previous models have disadvantages. It was no evaluation criteria for the player's experience aspects. So in this paper, we proposed a quality model that is designed specifically for online game quality requirements based on the indicators of online game characteristics. The proposed quality model develops based on the latest standards by ISO / IEC 25010. The model was evaluated on several online game types. The result is the quality model can evaluate the online games and we can know all the characteristics, strengths and weaknesses of an online game.

AB  - In modem textile industry, Tissue on line Automatic Inspection (T AI) is becoming an attractive alternative to human vision inspection (HVI). HVI needs a high level of human attention leading to a low level of performance in term of tissue inspection. Based on the advances in image processing and pattern recognition, T AI can potentially provide an objective and reliable evaluation on the fabric production quality. Most T AI systems claim to be able to detect the presence of defects in fabric products, and precisely locate the defects position. The motivation behind the fabric defect identification is to enable an on-line quality control of the weaving process. In this paper, a method based on texture analysis approach for identifying fabric defects in each image is proposed. Neural Networks and Mutual information are employed to characterize the texture property of a tissue image. A feature extractor is designed based on Mutual Information computation in conjunction with a classifier to minimize the error rate in defect classification.

AB  - Game development has recently gained a lot of momentum and is now a major software development industry. Platform games are being revived with both their 2D and 3D versions being developed. A major challenge faced by the industry is a lack of automated system-level approaches for game testing. Currently in most game development organizations, games are tested manually or using semi-automated techniques. Such testing techniques do not scale to the industry requirements where more systematic and repeatable approaches are required. In this paper we propose a model-based testing approach for automated black box functional testing of platform games. The paper provides a detailed modeling methodology to support automated system-level game testing. As part of the methodology, we provide guidelines for modeling the platform games for testing using our proposed game test modeling profile. We use domain modeling for representing the game structure and UML state machines for behavioral modeling. We present the details related to automated test case generation, execution, and oracle generation. We demonstrate our model-based testing approach by applying it on two cases studies, a widely referenced and open source implementation of Mario brothers game and an industrial case study of an endless runner game. The proposed approach was able to identify major faults in the open source game implementation. Our results showed that the proposed approach is practical and can be applied successfully on industrial games.

AB  - Automation testing is an important approach for bug detection and analysis of software applications, especially for computer games. This paper proposes an efficient imitation method to learn game strategy from a small set of manually recorded game samples, which only takes one hour to complete training. This work can be divided into four steps. Firstly, we collect a set of manually recorded data composed of image frames and user actions. The discriminative region is extracted from image to eliminate noise. Then, data alignment is applied to solve the problem of action delay. Due to the large variation of image samples from different classes, data resampling is performed to avoid bias. Finally, these samples are fed into a fast and lightweight network with LSTM structure, which is designed to boost speed of prediction. Our work discards the dependence of game internal interface and performs well in real time with CPU, which has been verified in a variety of commercial games.

AB  - Regression testing aims to check the functionality consistency during software evolution. Although general regression testing has been extensively studied, regression testing in the context of video games, especially Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Games (MMORPGs), is largely untouched so far. One big challenge is that game testing requires a certain level of intelligence in generating suitable action sequences among the huge search space, to accomplish complex tasks in the MMORPG. Existing game testing mainly relies on either the manual playing or manual scripting, which are labor-intensive and time-consuming. Even worse, it is often unable to satisfy the frequent industrial game evolution. The recent process in machine learning brings new opportunities for automatic game playing and testing. In this paper, we propose a reinforcement learning-based regression testing technique that explores differential behaviors between multiple versions of an MMORPGs such that the potential regression bugs could be detected. The preliminary evaluation on real industrial MMORPGs demonstrates the promising of our technique.

AB  - Game testing has been long recognized as a notoriously challenging task, which mainly relies on manual playing and scripting based testing in game industry. Even until recently, automated game testing still remains to be largely untouched niche. A key challenge is that game testing often requires to play the game as a sequential decision process. A bug may only be triggered until completing certain difficult intermediate tasks, which requires a certain level of intelligence. The recent success of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) sheds light on advancing automated game testing, without human competitive intelligent support. However, the existing DRLs mostly focus on winning the game rather than game testing. To bridge the gap, in this paper, we first perform an in-depth analysis of 1349 real bugs from four real-world commercial game products. Based on this, we propose four oracles to support automated game testing, and further propose Wuji, an on-the-fly game testing framework, which leverages evolutionary algorithms, DRL and multi-objective optimization to perform automatic game testing. Wuji balances between winning the game and exploring the space of the game. Winning the game allows the agent to make progress in the game, while space exploration increases the possibility of discovering bugs. We conduct a large-scale evaluation on a simple game and two popular commercial games. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of Wuji in exploring space and detecting bugs. Moreover, Wuji found 3 previously unknown bugs, which have been confirmed by the developers, in the commercial games.

AB  - B2C E-commerce sellers, buyers and platforms have been concerned about the return problem involved in online shopping. Investigation into sales return through B2C platforms with an aim to figure out the reasons behind it comes to a conclusion that the excludability of benefit of buyer and seller, the influence of Matthew Effect, the information asymmetry between buyer and seller, and the phenomenon of sellers sticking to low-price strategy while the buyers dependent on sales return are four reasons for keeping high return rate. Game analysis on B2C e-commerce platform, seller and buyer shall get underway. First, an income matrix covering the combination of the principle of liability without fault and the doctrine of presumption followed by contracting parties will come into being based on the game analysis is on sellers and buyers to reach the Nash equilibrium under rational state of both parties. Secondly, a conclusion that "the buyer's return action is a rational conduct" will arrive based on the game analysis on sellers and platforms. Lastly, the research finds that the return problem can be alleviated through three stages of strategy, including the rational guidance of customers before consumption, the adjustment of customer expectation in consumption and the promotion of product service after consumption.

AB  - Incipient fault diagnosis has become a key issue for reliability and safety of industrial processes. Data-driven methods are effective for feature extraction and feature analysis using multivariate statistical techniques. Beside fault detection, fault estimation is essential for making the appropriate decision (safe stop or fault accommodation). Therefore, in this paper, we have developed an analytical model of the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) for Gamma distributed data to be used for the fault severity estimation. In the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) framework, the proposed model of the KLD has been analysed and compared to an estimated value of the KLD using the Monte-Carlo estimator. The results show that for incipient faults (&lt;;10%) in usual noise conditions (SNR&gt;40dB), the analytical model is accurate enough with a relative error around 10%.

AB  - Bugs that persist into releases of video games can have negative impacts on both developers and users, but particular aspects of testing in game development can lead to difficulties in effectively catching these missed bugs. It has become common practice for developers to apply updates to games in order to fix missed bugs. These updates are often accompanied by notes that describe the changes to the game included in the update. However, some bugs reappear even after an update attempts to fix them. In this paper, we develop a taxonomy for bug types in games that is based on prior work. We examine 12,122 bug fixes from 723 updates for 30 popular games on the Steam platform. We label the bug fixes included in these updates to identify the frequency of these different bug types, the rate at which bug types recur over multiple updates, and which bug types are treated as more severe. Additionally, we survey game developers regarding their experience with different bug types and what aspects of game development they most strongly associate with bug appearance. We find that Information bugs appear the most frequently in updates, while Crash bugs recur the most frequently and are often treated as more severe than other bug types. Finally, we find that challenges in testing, code quality, and bug reproduction have a close association with bug persistence. These findings should help developers identify which aspects of game development could benefit from greater attention in order to prevent bugs. Researchers can use our results in devising tools and methods to better identify and address certain bug types.

AB  - General Video Game Playing (GVGP) has become a popular line of research in the past years, leading to the existence of a wide range of general algorithms created to tackle this challenge. This paper proposes taking advantage of this research to help in game design and testing processes. It introduces a methodology consisting of using a team of Artificial General Intelligence agents with differentiated goals (winning, exploring, collecting items, killing NPCs, etc.) and skill levels. Using several agents with distinct behaviours that play the same game simultaneously can provide substantial information to influence design and bug fixing. Two methods are proposed to aid game design: 1) the evaluation of a game based on the expected performance in the behaviour of each of the agents, and 2) the provision of visual information to analyse how the experience of the agents evolves during the play-through. Having this methodology available to designers can help them decide if the game or level under analysis fits the initial expectations. Including a Logging System can also be used to detect anomalies while the development is still at an early stage. We believe this approach allows the flexibility and portability to be easily applied to games with different characteristics.

AB  - Machine-to-machine (M2M) communication faces the most critical challenge that when a massive number of MTC devices perform random access, there will be severe congestions. 3GPP developed a network coordinated random access stabilization scheme known as the access class barring(ACB) to deal with the problem in LTE-Advanced. However, MTC devices in overlapped areas still suffer severe access delays due to the noncooperation and individual setting of ACB factor among BSs. We propose evolutionary game based ACB algorithm to help MTC devices alleviate congestions and thus eliminate substantial defects in the ordinary ACB. Finally, the performance of the evolutionary game based ACB algorithm is analysed, and simulation results show the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

AB  - We present an application of data mining to the analysis and tuning of Bad Blood, a video game for Windows Phone developed for the 2012 Microsoft's Imagine Cup competition. The game was developed on a very short time frame (four months) by a small student team (three programmers and one designer). Because of the limited development time available the game could not undergo extensive playtest. More importantly, since the game had to be submitted to the competition we could not leverage digital distribution to update the game, identify design flaws or fix bugs. Accordingly, before submitting the game, we decided to instrument the code to collect as much information as possible about the gameplay, and performed a rather limited playtest during two public events. Then, we applied data mining both to look for peculiar characteristics of the platforms employed, to discover interesting patterns, and to identify flaws and/or opportunities in our game design. Overall, we identified at least one major design flaw regarding the pace in one specific game mode which we solved by introducing new game elements. We also discovered some design opportunities to inherently modify the game difficulty by leveraging upon the way players tend to use the devices.

AB  - The diverse cyber attacks, that make operation of the smart grid challenging, must be addressed before wide adoption of smart grids can be fully realized. Although a number of research efforts have been devoted to defending against these threats, a majority of existing schemes focus on the design of a specific defensive strategy to deal with a specific threat. In this paper we address the issue of coalitional attacks that can be launched by multiple adversaries cooperatively in the smart grid. We propose a game-theoretic based model to capture the interaction among multiple adversaries and quantify the capacity of the defender based on the extended Iterated Public Goods Game (IPGG) model. In the formalized game model, each participant can either cooperate by participating in the coalitional attack, or defect by standing aside in each round of the attack. We consider the generic defensive strategy that has a probability to detect the coalitional attack. When the coalitional attack is detected, all the participating adversaries are penalized. The expected payoff of each participant is derived through the zero-determinant strategy that provides the participants competitive benefits. Via a combination of theoretical analysis and experiments, our results show that our formalized game model can enable the defender to greatly reduce the maximum value of the expected average payoff to the adversaries via provisioning sufficient defensive resources, which is reflected by setting a proper penalty factor against the adversaries.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel diagnosis approach, using game theory, to solve the comparison-based system-level fault identification problem in distributed and parallel systems based on the asymmetric comparison model. Under this diagnosis model tasks are assigned to pairs of nodes and the results of executing these tasks are compared. Using the agreements and disagreements among the nodes' outputs, i.e., the input syndrome, the fault diagnosis algorithm identifies the fault status of the system's nodes, under the assumption that at most t of these nodes can permanently fail simultaneously. Since the introduction of the comparison model, significant progress has been made in both theory and practice associated with the original model and its offshoots. Nevertheless, the problem of efficiently identifying the set of faulty nodes when not all the comparison outcomes are available to the fault identification algorithm prior to initiating the diagnosis phase, i.e., partial syndromes, remains an outstanding research issue. In this paper, we first show how game theory can be adapted to solve the fault diagnosis problem by maximizing the payoffs of all players (nodes). We then demonstrate, using results from a thorough simulation, the effectiveness of this approach in solving the fault identification problem using partial syndromes from randomly generated diagnosable systems of different sizes and under various fault scenarios.

AB  - The intelligent electronic devices widely deployed across the distribution network are inevitably making the feeder automation (FA) system more vulnerable to cyber-attacks, which would lead to disastrous socio-economic impacts. This paper proposes a three-stage game-theoretic framework that the defender allocates limited security resources to minimize the economic impacts on FA system while the attacker deploys limited attack resources to maximize the corresponding impacts. Meanwhile, the probability of successful attack is calculated based on the Bayesian attack graph, and a fault-tolerant location technique for centralized FA system is elaborately considered during analysis. The proposed game-theoretic framework is converted into a two-level zero-sum game model and solved by the particle swarm optimization (PSO) combined with a generalized reduced gradient algorithm. Finally, the proposed model is validated on distribution network for RBTS bus 2.

AB  - The aim of this work is to understand the role of gamma radiation in trap creation and/or trapping and detrapping space charge mechanisms in isotactic polypropylene (iPP). The measurements are performed on 25 Œºm thick films: virgin polypropylene and one irradiated with gamma rays at a dose of 100 kGy. The experimental study is focused on measuring final thermostimulated discharge currents. At the end of the isothermal discharge process, obtained after charging under a DC field of 4 MV/m, the temperature was increased from 40 ¬∞C at a heating rate of 3 ¬∞C/mn. As a result, the discharging current of the irradiated film exhibits two peaks, the first one at 75 ¬∞C and the second one, of lower amplitude, at 122 ¬∞C. It was noticed that no peak was obtained in virgin iPP even at other charging temperatures. Indeed, gamma irradiation creates defects in the polymer that constitute traps of various depths, depending on the nature of the defect. The transient charging current exhibits oscillations (or multiple peaks) associated with charge packets and the current-voltage characteristic shows that the current is controlled by the space charge (IŒ±V<sup>2</sup>). The differential scanning calorimetry DSC analysis shows a glass transition temperature of 9.4 ¬∞C and a crystallization temperature of 114 ¬∞C.

AB  - In this paper, a hybrid genetic algorithm based on information entropy and game theory was proposed in order to cope with the defect that traditional genetic algorithm easily falls into local optimum. First of all, initial population was generated through the way that population diversity was calculated by information entropy. It, in combination with parallel genetic algorithm, performed evolutionary operation by adopting standard genetic algorithm (GA), partheno-genetic algorithm (PGA), and hybrid genetic algorithm integrating standard genetic algorithm and partheno-genetic algorithm (GA-PGA). Secondly, it operated game of complete information to population at parallel nodes in accordance with information entropy and fitness value of each sub-population, hoping to optimize the whole population. Finally, two program verification functions were introduced, i.e. Rosenbrock and Rastrigin, to analyze performance superiority of algorithm. It shows from the results that, when compared with the traditional genetic algorithm, this algorithm boasts of good optimization ability and solving precision and is characterized by high convergence rate and stability.

AB  - An important scenario for smart grids which encompass distributed electrical networks is given by the simultaneous presence of aggregators and individual consumers. In this work, an aggregator is seen as an entity (a coalition) which is able to manage jointly the energy demand of a large group of consumers or users. More precisely, the demand consists in charging an electrical vehicle (EV) battery. The way the EVs user charge their batteries matters since it strongly impacts the network, especially the distribution network costs (e.g., in terms of Joule losses or transformer ageing). Since the charging policy is chosen by the users or the aggregators, the charging problem is naturally distributed. It turns out that one of the tools suited to tackle this heterogenous scenario has been introduced only recently namely, through the notion of composite games. This paper exploits for the first time in the literature of smart grids the notion of composite game and equilibrium. By assuming a rectangular charging profile for an EV, a composite equilibrium analysis is conducted, followed by a detailed analysis of a case study which assumes three possible charging periods or time-slots. Both the provided analytical and numerical results allow one to better understand the relationship between the size (which is a measure) of the coalition and the network sum-cost. In particular, a social dilemma, a situation where everybody prefers unilaterally defecting to cooperating, while the consequence is the worst for all, is exhibited.

AB  - Runtime verification is the process of observing a sequence of events generated by a running system and comparing it to some formal specification for potential violations. We show how the use of a runtime monitor can greatly speed up the testing phase of a video game under development, by automating the detection of bugs when the game is being played. We take advantage of the fact that a video game, contrarily to generic software, follows a special structure that contains a "game loop", this game loop can be used to centralize the instrumentation and generate events based on the game's internal state. We report on experiments made on a sample of five real-world video games of various genres and sizes, by successfully incrementing and efficiently monitoring various temporal properties over their execution-including actual bugs reported in the games' bug tracking database in the course of their development.

AB  - This Innovative Practice Full Paper describes a pedagogical technique for introducing unit testing within software engineering courses. The Bug Hide-and-Seek educational game reinforces testing principles by requiring students to develop some correct solutions as well as some other solutions that intentionally contain bugs. While developing the correct and buggy solutions, students also write corresponding tests that should identify whether each solution contains bugs or exhibits acceptable behavior. Consequently, the first goal of the game is to hide a clever bug that will trick other students' tests into passing the implementation, despite the hidden bug. The second goal is to write thorough tests that can accurately differentiate correct from incorrect software behavior. We introduce the motivation, pedagogy, and preliminary analysis of two variations of the Bug Hide-and-Seek game, while comparing their tradeoffs. The between-subject variation considers each student's test suite in its entirety. The within-subject variation requires more sophisticated analysis, but considers each individual function along with its corresponding tests, which provides more granular insight and specific feedback to students. We conducted a pilot study of both variations over two semesters of students (n=87) playing the Bug Hide-and-Seek game. We found that students' test True Positive Rate and True Negative Rate at verifying implementations are both significant predictors of a lack of bugs in their own solution.

AB  - CMOS image sensors (CIS) are more and more used in space applications. However, radiation induced dark-current noise degradation remains a dominant problem impacting the image quality. Especially, under total ionizing dose (TID) radiation, the energy deposited in the CMOS photodiodes generates numbers of defects which result in serious dark-current degradation. In order to estimate energy deposition under TID radiation, a method based on GEANT4 simulation is proposed in this paper, including the target-model founding, gamma-ray establishing, physical processes description, energy deposition calculation and data analysis. A detailed analysis is implemented to clarify the energy deposition in the different layers of the model.

AB  - Machine learning and data mining have become ubiquitous tools in modern computing applications and large enterprise systems benefit from its adaptability and intelligent ability to infer patterns that can be used for prediction or decision-making. Great success has been achieved by applying machine learning and data mining to the security settings for large dataset, such as in intrusion detection, virus detection, biometric identity recognition, and spam filtering. However, the strengths of the learning systems, such as the adaptability and ability to infer patterns, can also become their vulnerabilities when there are adversarial manipulations during the learning and predicting process. Considering the fact that the traditional learning strategies could potentially introduce security faults into the learning systems, robust machine learning techniques against the sophisticated adversaries need to be studied, which is referred to as secure learning and mining through this abstract. Based on the goal of secure learning and mining, I aim to analyze the behavior of learning systems in adversarial environments by studying different kinds of attacks against the learning systems. Then design robust learning algorithms to counter the corresponding malicious behaviors based on the evaluation and prediction of the adversaries' goal and capabilities. The interactions between the defender and attackers are modeled as different forms of games, therefore game theoretic analysis are applied to evaluate and predict the constraints for both participants to deal with the real world large dataset.

AB  - Explainability remains the holy grail in designing the next-generation pervasive artificial intelligence (AI) systems. Current neural network based AI design methods do not naturally lend themselves to reasoning for a decision making process from the input data. A primary reason for this is the overwhelming arithmetic complexity.Built on the foundations of propositional logic and game theory, the principles of learning automata are increasingly gaining momentum for AI hardware design. The lean logic based processing has been demonstrated with significant advantages of energy efficiency and performance. The hierarchical logic underpinning can also potentially provide opportunities for by-design explainable and dependable AI hardware. In this paper, we study explainability and dependability using reachability analysis in two simulation environments. Firstly, we use a behavioral SystemC model to analyze the different state transitions. Secondly, we carry out illustrative fault injection campaigns in a low-level SystemC environment to study how reachability is affected in the presence of hardware stuck-at 1 faults. Our analysis provides the first insights into explainable decision models and demonstrates dependability advantages of learning automata driven AI hardware design.

AB  - It is well-known that the correct strategy in iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with a finite known number of rounds is to always defect. Evolution of Prisoner's Dilemma playing agents mirrors this: the more rounds the agents play against each other per encounter, the more likely the population will evolve to a cooperative state. Prior work has demonstrated that the result of evolution changes dramatically from very short games up to about 60-85 rounds, which yields substantially similar populations as those using 150 rounds. We extend this study using more powerful statistical tests and mathematical tools, including fingerprinting and play profiles, to consider the problem in the opposite direction: as the correct strategy in infinitely iterated Prisoner's Dilemma is to always cooperate, how many rounds are needed until evolution reflects this empirically? Within a very large plateau, from around 150 to a million rounds, evolution does not significantly change its behaviour. Surprisingly, behaviour does change again from millions to billions of rounds, but not further from billions to infinite-round games. This suggests that evolution operates on nontrivial categories of cooperativity depending on the number of rounds and the details of the representation.

AB  - Video-game projects are notorious for having day- one bugs, no matter how big their budget or team size. The quality of a game is essential for its success. This quality could be assessed and ensured through testing. However, to the best of our knowledge, little is known about video-game testing. In this paper, we want to understand how game developers perform game testing. We investigate, through a survey, the academic and gray literature to identify and report on existing testing processes and how they could automate them. We found that game developers rely, almost exclusively, upon manual play-testing and the testers' intrinsic knowledge. We conclude that current testing processes fall short because of their lack of automation, which seems to be the natural next step to improve the quality of games while maintaining costs. However, the current game-testing techniques may not generalize to different types of games.

The proposed controller is divided into two parts: (1) distributed differential game control policy of the fault-free systems and (2) fault compensator. The presented controller, not only guarantees the multi-agent system is uniformly ultimately bounded (UUB), but also minimizes the cooperative performance index function. The effectiveness is demonstrated by a simulation.

AB  - Software development, like any prolonged and intellectually demanding activity, can negatively affect the motivation of developers. This is especially true in specific areas of software engineering, such as requirements engineering, test-driven development, bug reporting and fixing, where the creative aspects of programming fall short. The developers' engagement might progressively degrade, potentially impacting their work's quality. Gamification, the use of game elements and game design techniques in non-game contexts, is hailed as a means to boost the motivation of people for a wide range of rote activities. Indeed, well-designed games deeply involve gamers in a positive loop of production, feedback, and reward, eliciting desirable feelings like happiness and collaboration. The question we investigate is how the seemingly frivolous context of games and gamification can be ported to the technically challenging and sober domain of software engineering. Our investigation starts with a review of the state of the art of gamification, supported by a motivating scenario to expose how gamification elements can be integrated in software engineering. We provide a set of basic building blocks to apply gamification techniques, present a conceptual framework to do so, illustrated in two usage contexts, and critically discuss our findings.

AB  - Being instrumental in electric energy data collection for energy data collection and supervisory systems, the reliability of an electric energy collector not only affects the reliability of the system, but also directly influences users' satisfaction. With the objective of addressing the problem of reliability assessment of an electric energy data collector, the failure mechanism of the data collector was first identified, followed by a cyclical acceleration method, which includes a sub test known as step stress test. Based on the exponential distribution of the fault time of the electrical energy collector, the Gamma distribution was assumed as the prior distribution and a multilevel Bayesian no-failure data statistical analysis method was used to calculate the average life span of the collector using the experimental data. Further, we adopted the Arrhenius equation under temperature stress and the activation energy value of electronic products to calculate the reliable life expectancy of the electrical energy collector under the normal operating temperatures. Additionally, this method is suitable for other electric energy data collectors as the main structure and working principle are similar.

AB  - In this paper, we contribute in solving the system-level fault diagnosis (SLD) problem under the symmetric invalidation rules. The SLD aims at determining faulty nodes based on an input syndrome that is generated comparing the outputs from the different nodes. The symmetric comparison diagnosis model assumes that tasks are assigned to pairs of nodes and the results of executing these tasks are compared. Fault nodes are identified based on the agreements and disagreements among the nodes' outputs. A limit t is assumed on the maximum number of nodes that can fail simultaneously. Various diagnosis algorithms have been developed in the last decades, but the problem of efficiently identifying the set of faulty units of a diagnosable system remained an outstanding research issue. This work introduces a new diagnosis approach for the symmetric-based comparison diagnosis problem using game theory. In this approach, faulty nodes are identified by maximizing the payoffs of all players (nodes). We have tested the new diagnosis approach using randomly generated diagnosable systems under even extreme faulty situations in which the limit t was set close to the number of nodes. The extensive simulations we have conducted proved the efficiency of the new game-theory-based diagnosis algorithm as it succeeded in guessing the fault status all nodes in all faulty situations.

In addition, the gesture recognition method is based on the shadow images by a web camera. Firstly, we set the region of interest on the screen. Secondly, we separate the hand shadows by the binary image. Finally, we use the convex hull, the defect and Hu's invariant moment methods to distinguish gestures and motions based on geometrical feature. The registered virtual shadows will create and interact according to the change of the real shadows. In the end, several special experiments show that our shadow-based simulation framework has well recognition and tracking efficiency.

AB  - Ad hoc networks comprise independent cooperative nodes which work together to constitute a system having a value greater than the sum of the values of the individual components. The nodes cooperate to gain access to the medium or to establish a messaging infrastructure by relaying foreign packets. However, when nodes in an ad hoc network operate autonomously without a central authority, they tend to defect, e.g., do not forward each other's packets following the game theoretic analysis. External mechanisms may preserve and enforce cooperation in network in return of additional operational costs or security overheads. However, low power devices may lack computational power that is required to implement the system. Recent works in evolutionary game theory have shown that cooperation may survive in a lattice structured biological network without any enforcement. The spatial structure of the network may allow the survival of the cooperative nodes when they imitate the dominant surrounding strategy. Imitating strategy helps low power devices adapt dynamically to the environment rather than giving deterministic and static decisions. In this work, we apply the imitation strategy to ad hoc networks which have geometric random network structure different from the lattice structured networks. Simulations show that simple imitation strategy allows cooperation to be spread over the network.

AB  - All currently existing IDS are vulnerable to attacks and have various degrees of weakness. Our goal was to undertake the diagnostic of the most popular IDS and to identify its key weak points. For the purpose of this work, we examined Network-based IDS. We analyzed the responses of ID Systems to denial-of-service attacks. All tested systems were more or less vulnerable to this kind of attacks. The analysis of testing allowed to develop mathematical models, based on the game theory, and also the methodology and the criteria for assessment of reliability of a specific ID system. The research undertaken evidences that IDS cannot be absolutely safe and secure, and provides data which can be used for the configuration of such systems to enhance their reliability and fault tolerance.

AB  - Optical fibers are used routinely in harsh environments for signal transmission or sensing applications. Whereas the individual challenges originating from very high or very low temperatures, vacuum or ionizing radiation were extensively studied, the effects of combinations of these conditions were not investigated widely. In this paper we report on a detailed analysis of gamma irradiation tests done on Germanium-doped single-mode fibers at very low temperatures of 16 K. The drastic change in radiation response is shown with varying temperatures through measurements with discrete light sources and a spectral measurement system. To monitor the temperature in the fibers, Fiber-Bragg-Gratings (FBG) were used and their response under radiation observed. The findings will be valuable for determination of the temperature dependence of the point-defect formation as well as for specialized applications at low temperatures, such as accelerators or deep space missions.

AB  - Writing good software tests is difficult and not every developer's favorite occupation. Mutation testing aims to help by seeding artificial faults (mutants) that good tests should identify, and test generation tools help by providing automatically generated tests. However, mutation tools tend to produce huge numbers of mutants, many of which are trivial, redundant, or semantically equivalent to the original program, automated test generation tools tend to produce tests that achieve good code coverage, but are otherwise weak and have no clear purpose. In this paper, we present an approach based on gamification and crowdsourcing to produce better software tests and mutants: The Code Defenders web-based game lets teams of players compete over a program, where attackers try to create subtle mutants, which the defenders try to counter by writing strong tests. Experiments in controlled and crowdsourced scenarios reveal that writing tests as part of the game is more enjoyable, and that playing Code Defenders results in stronger test suites and mutants than those produced by automated tools.

Sometimes introductory college classes are notoriously called ‚Äúweed-out‚Äù courses, which students who fall behind, are discouraged from continuing the career path. Students with different educational backgrounds may be unnecessarily defeated in these courses. In this work, we identify what class data can be collected and supplied to data analytic tooling to generate insights into monitoring the students' progress. We first investigate a variety of machine learning tools and techniques on a class dataset. Then, we present work-in-progress designs of a visual analytic workflow. Through the interaction with the visual analytic tool, instructors of the introductory computer science course gather insights into the class, for example, ‚ÄúWhich part of the programming assignment is causing students to have the most software bugs?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhich exam questions best test the understanding of runtime analysis?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat type of student activity results in fascinating over 50% of the class to participate and understand the material‚Äù?

AB  - In this paper, an optimal fault-tolerant control (FTC) method using zero-sum differential game is proposed for a class of nonlinear systems with actuator faults. Firstly, it is reveals that the FTC problem is equivalent to a zero-sum differential game problem, in which the controller and the fault are regarded as two opposite players. Secondly, the Nash-equilibrium is established by minimax principle, and the coupling Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs (HJI) equation is further solved by adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) method. Besides, a FTC learning law of the weight is proposed, which only uses a critic network. Finally, an example is given to illustrate the efficiency and applicability of the obtained theoretical results.

The obvious de-anonymity approach that matches transaction addresses and users is not possible in practice due to limited annotated data set. In this paper, we divide addresses into four types, exchange, gambling, service, and general, and propose targeted addresses identification algorithms with high fault tolerance which may be employed in a wide range of applications. We use network representation learning to extract features and train imbalanced multi-classifiers. Experimental results validated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

AB  - Hyperspectral processing technology becomes one of the most focused issues in remote sensing field. In the hyperspectral classification, significant improvements have been achieved by various deep learning methods. In general, deep learning algorithms adopt a cascade of layers to extract the hierarchical features. However, the deep hierarchical property will cause some defects such as overfitting and gradient vanishing. In this paper, a hybrid method based on CapsNet and Triple-GANs has been explored to avoid overfitting and extract the effective features. Unlike ordinary CNN, the CapsNet is the consist of a group of capsules with vectorizing the activation output which could consider not only spectral deep features but also the relative locations of these features. The Triple-GANs is a game system with three players: a generator, a classifier and a discriminator. When the Triple-GANs converges to balance, the credible labelled samples could been obtained by the generator which boost the CapsNet in the classification task.The main contents are as follows: 1)By introducing the CapsNet in the hyperspectral feature extraction, the 2D convolution operations are replaced by 1D to adapt the pixel-wised spectral features. 2) Use the Triple-GANs and CapsNet to do the hyperspectral classification on small training dataset. Experimental results show that this algorithm can obviously improve the performance of classification compared with the traditional methods.

AB  - For a finite, well-mixed population of heterogeneous agents playing evolutionary games choosing to cooperate or defect in each round of the game, we investigate, when agents update their strategies in each round using the myopic best-response rule, how the number of cooperating agents changes over time and demonstrate how to control that number by changing the agents' payoff matrices. The agents are heterogeneous in that their payoff matrices may differ from one another; we focus on the specific case when the payoff matrices, fixed throughout the evolution, correspond to prisoner's dilemma or snowdrift games. To carry out stability analysis, we identify the system's absorbing states when taking the number of cooperating agents as a random variable of interest. It is proven that when all the agents update frequently enough, the reachable final states are completely determined by the available types of payoff matrices. As a further step, we show how to control the final state by changing at the beginning of the evolution, the types of the payoff matrices of a group of agents.

The faults are malicious rather than accidental, which change the payoffs of certain strategies for all agents, thus may affect the stability of the equilibrium and the domain of attraction (DOA). To realize the purpose of FTC, an incentive-based method is proposed. Finally, the case of population with mutation is also mentioned.

AB  - The optical losses spectra in 300-800 nm region of silica core fibers with high and low OH-group content is measured in-situ and after 10 minutes of irradiation by Œ≥-rays of <sup>60</sup>Co source. In-situ optical losses are separated to fast annealing (transient) and residual (stable) parts in order to analyze behavior of transient color centers with the change of dose and dose rate. The linear dependence of the magnitude of transient absorption caused by transient color centers is observed as a function of dose and its saturation at the dose ~5¬∑10<sup>7</sup> Rad in silica core silica clad fiber is achieved. The saturation of transient color centers in silica core polymer clad fibers is achieved at ~10<sup>7</sup> Rad. The dependence of radiation-induced optical losses on dose rate is linear within the observed values 6-360 R/s. It's supposed that creation mechanism and concentration of transient color centers depend on OH-group content as well as core diameter and preliminary defects in fibers.

However, existing tools sometimes yield so many warnings that developers tend to ignore such warnings. To deal with this problem, we propose a gamified tool for motivating developers to remove such warnings. Our tool employs the gamification technique that calculates points by counting removed warnings with respect to each developer and each team. The points give developers feedback and urge them to compete with each other. We confirmed that developers removed about 150% warnings with our tool in comparison with the case where they did not use our tool through an experiment.

AB  - Cooperation is not only essential but favorable to human societies, animals and even molecules. Altruistic punishment is affirmed as one of solutions to elevate collaborative efforts, nonetheless, we can't ignore the inherent deficiency. Hence selfish punishment is put forward, the spatial public goods game (PGGs) with retaliation comprises of unconditional defectors, pure co operators, and retaliative co operators who retrieve part of payoffs which are created by their own from defectors except to contribute. This inhibits second-order free-riders and conquers the limitation of costly punishment. As is known to all selfishness is human nature. In human a typical human society, restitution against selfish behavior can be achieved through legal or arbitration proceedings, or perhaps ultra-legal means such as hiring gangsters, maybe the ways are resemblance to peer-punishment. This study invokes some interesting phenomenon like fault age and that all-C and all-D status change alternately. In addition to a dazzling visual graph of rock-paper-scissors type, the three strategies often appear as "mantis catching cicada yellowbird behind". Our conclusions indicate that retaliation is highly dependent on the synergy factor.

AB  - Delivering high-quality electrical power requires an efficient, reliable protective system that can handle failures on transmission lines, which occur due to varies random causes. Detecting, classifying, and locating faults can prevent further damage to electrical supply equipment. The digital technology has brought unquestionable improvements in numerical relay design in terms of criteria signals estimation in a short time, better filtering, self-monitoring features, etc. However, it did not make a breakthrough in power system protection, as far as security, dependability, and speed of operation are concerned. The relaying task, however, can be approached as a pattern recognition problem. To improve the performance of protection, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) approach has been perceived by researchers in power system protection field. By monitoring the relaying inputs, the relay can be trained using ANN to classify the ongoing signals between faults and all other conditions. Therefore, this paper presents an intelligent method to design an online Simulink model of a distance relay. The Artificial Neural Network ANN, three-layer, Feed-forward networks with backpropagation algorithm for each phase (voltage and current) were selected to achieve this design. The designed relay is composed of fault detection and fault type algorithm block, fault classification algorithm block, and fault location algorithm block, as well as the best network structure for each of the previous blocks, which have been determined. Moreover, the relay was evaluated under approximately all various fault types and different fault locations. The Simulation results show that the ANN method is effective in detecting faults on transmission lines.

AB  - With decreasing feature sizes and increasing complexity of fabrication processes for manufacturing VLSI semiconductor devices, more systematic defects occur at the advanced technology nodes. Product yield ramp up is mostly determined by how fast systematic defects are identified and fixed. Given the long times and expense of physical failure analysis (PFA), use PFA on a large number of failing devices to find systematic defects is becoming infeasible. For this reason, volume diagnosis data mining for root cause identification based on statistical methods is used to reduce turnaround time and cost to speed up the process of systematic defect identification. The identified root cause information not only can be used to improve yield analysis but also can reduce PFA cost by focusing on failing devices with systematic defects.

AB  - The article proposes the mathematical model of the functional reliability of pipeline with the redundancy (PR), which contains the elements of strength, hydraulic and game theory models. The distribution optimum criterion of the transported product between the PR parallel sections is substantiated taking into account the action uncertainty of the environment factors on the defects development in the pipe and the functional characteristics of PR sections. The strength resource is proposed as the index of the functional reliability of PR section, as a difference in the maximum and working intra-tube of pressures in the diagnosed defect place. The example of the guaranteed strength resource calculation for the pipeline system with the duplicating is given.

AB  - Cloud computing offers computing and storage services which can be dynamically developed, composed and deployed on virtualized infrastructure. Cloud providers holding excess spare capacity, incentivize customers to purchase it by selling them in a market (spot market), where the prices are derived dynamically based on supply and demand. The cloud providers allow clients to bid on this excess capacity by allocating resources to bidders while their bids exceed a intermittently changing dynamic spot price. In this paper we have used game theory to model the bidding strategies of bidders in a spot market who are attempting to procure the cloud instances, as a prisoner dilemma game. We then analyze real time data from Amazon EC2 spot market to validate this model. In a single shot prisoner dilemma game mutual defection is the Nash equilibrium. We find that a majority (approx. 85%) of bidders choose to Defect which is in-line with the single shot classical prisoner dilemma game. However considering that most bidders in a spot market are repetitive bidders, we propose a Co-operation strategy which is in-line with the Iterated Prisoner Dilemma Game.

AB  - During the last decade, many Iranian software and game developers have targeted Android as their main development framework, resulting in the availability of a large number of Android applications. Despite the opportunities that Android provides for application developers, it introduces new challenges for the development of high quality applications. In this paper, we have focused on responsiveness and fault-tolerance as two interesting quality attributes of Android applications, lack of which might result in users' dissatisfaction and leaving the application. Hence, we have conducted an experimental study, using monkey testing technique, on a set of Iranian Android games to assess their robustness and responsiveness. The results demonstrate that much more attention needs to be paid by Iranian Android developers to the responsiveness and fault-tolerance of their applications, since about 85% of the analyzed games have shown to have at least one responsiveness or robustness error.

AB  - In recent years, the manufacturing industry of distribution transformer (DT) in China develops rapidly with high competition. Since the pass rates of National Surveillance Sampling in China (NSSC) for DTs keep a low level, the quality is worried. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the investment of distribution network construction will reach 1.7 trillion RMB, which makes a big market for DTs. It is significant to study on optimization of sampling inspection mode and strategy, which can improve the efficiency, quality level, and the reliability of power supply. The research status and theory of sampling inspection are analyzed. The sampling action mechanism is analyzed based on game theory, where the quality cost theory is put forward. The quality cost model with zero-defect is analyzed. The key factors of the sampling inspection for DT are analyzed, including the risk, maneuverability, and economics of the test item. The optimization method of sampling inspection mode is proposed, where three sampling inspection modes are given out. The strategy with dynamic adjustment is put forward. The index system of sampling inspection is designed, which can reflect the efficiency objectively. Finally, the method is verified by the real examples.

AB  - In this paper, we focus on studying the effects of various image operations on sensor fingerprint camera identification. It is known that artifacts in the image processing pipeline, such as pixel defects or unevenness of the responses in the CCD array as well black current noise leave telltale footprints. Nowadays, camera identification based on the analysis of these artifacts is a well established technology for linking an image to a specific camera. The sensor fingerprint is estimated from images taken from a device. A similarity measure is deployed in order to associate an image with the camera. However, when the images used in the sensor fingerprint estimation have been processed using e.g. gamma correction, contrast enhancement, histogram equalization or white balance, the properties of the detection statistic change, hence affecting fingerprint detection. In this paper we study this effect experimentally, towards quantifying the robustness of fingerprint detection in the presence of image processing operations.

AB  - Social dilemmas require individuals to choose between their own interests (by defecting) or group interests (by cooperating). N-player mathematical games such as public goods games have been extensively investigated to identify circumstances that promote cooperation in social dilemmas. In this paper the tragedy of the commons, a related social dilemma, is investigated. The population consists of cooperators, defectors and altruists. It is shown it is possible to evolve strategies that resolve (i.e., solve) a tragedy of the commons social dilemma. It will also be shown how trigger strategies can significantly increase cooperation levels in the population. Proximate explanations for why these trigger strategies work are offered.

AB  - This paper discusses a decentralized energy management for an engine-generator/battery/ultracapacitor (UC) hybrid energy system with fault tolerance analysis. The energy management problem among the energy suppliers and the load is formed into a non-cooperative power distribution game where the engine-generator, the battery pack, the UC pack, and the load are modeled as independent and related players. Each player has an unique objective, i.e., reducing fuel consumption, prolonging battery cycle life, maintaining UC state of charge and satisfying the load demands, represented by different second order polynomial function based utility functions. In this game, a Nash equilibrium is reached at each control instant to give a balanced solution among players. The weight coefficients in the utility functions can be determined through the Pareto optimal solution a multi-objective genetic algorithm. The fault tolerance analysis based simulation shows that the proposed energy management has a flexible and reconfigurable performance under six different case studies.

AB  - X-Ray Diffraction Imaging (XRDI) is used to non-destructively image strain in Si associated with deep trench isolation in high voltage devices. The XRD images show that there is dark contrast associated with deep trenches which is indicative of strain and defects in a material. Using defect etching, it is shown that there is a tendency for higher dislocation densities in regions where there is dark contrast in the XRD image. These results suggest that XRD imaging can be a useful tool for optimizing layout and processes for devices with deep trench isolation.

AB  - Cloud computing is a model that allows users to rent the services they want, in real time, and pay as they go. Thanks to virtualization, Cloud infrastructure exploitation will be easier and smoother because it offers many benefits to data center administrators and end users. The main goal of virtualization is to share the infrastructure between users with high isolation level, and to take advantages of their physical resources as much as possible. Fault of isolation, Cloud hypervisor doesn't have a great vision on the sharing and management of resources between virtual machines, hence a contention on shared resources will take place, it identifies by performance interference. In this paper, we study the effects of performance interference between Co-located VMs, we try to grasp the VMs that does not produce a lot of performance degradation based on the fuzzy formal concepts analysis(FFCA), with the aim of proposing a new virtual machine placement approach that first minimizes performance interference and communication costs, second maximizes and balances the use of cloud resources.

AB  - Intermetallic alloys based on gamma titanium aluminide (Œ≥-TiAl) are considered to be one of the best replacements for nickel-based super alloys (used in gas turbine blade) because of their unique set of properties. However the machinability of Œ≥-TiAl is faced with restrictions and limitations due to the alloy's mechanical and metallurgical properties. Some of the most restricting properties include high temperature yield strength and wear resistance, even at elevated temperatures. Machining of Œ≥-TiAl can also cause defects such as the formation of micro cracks on the machined surfaces. To explore the surface integrity of Œ≥-TiAl under different cutting conditions, a series of machining experiments were carried out. High-speed and ultra-high-speed milling of Œ≥-TiAl were examined under dry and minimum quantity lubrication (MQL) conditions. This research outlines the effects of cutting conditions on the surface integrity and Machining Affected Zone (MAZ). Two- and three-dimensional surface parameters were measured. In addition, the effects of machining parameters were studied using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). In addition, a mathematical model for the surface roughness measurements was developed in the present work. Likewise, other effects of surface alterations, including material pullout, deformations of the lamellae and micro cracks, were studied with optical microscopes (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopes (SEM). Microhardness evaluation of the surface and subsurface indicated a significant difference between the surface and the bulk of the material (subsurface layers). X-ray diffraction analysis showed a phase transformation on the machined surfaces. Finally, the results of the present work are compared with previous works on machining of gamma titanium aluminide.

AB  - When the multi-fault occured in distribution systems, the scheduling scheme of repair's resource plays an important role in the rush repairs and restoration of power supply. However, it is difficult to set a reliable restoration scheme quickly only by experience of dispatchers, because the multi-fault restoration involves many factors. Therefore, this paper discusses how to make a scientific and reasonable restoration scheme, and a multi-fault distribution system repairment model is established according to the revenue function. Composed of analysis and decision Agent (ADA), some rush-repair team Agents (RTA) and the supervisory and paradigm Agent (SPA), the multi-agent system is set up. And the model of game theory is determined by the complexity of the fault location to recover. The optimal strategy of multifault rush repair in distribution systems is obtained by looking for the Nash equilibrium point. Finally, the example shows that we could get the repair strategy efficiently and reduce the outage loss.

AB  - The development of circuit testing and verification methods is commonly driven by formal analysis centered on an abstract mathematical model of the error or defect the method is designed to detect. Hardware Trojans, however, confound attempts to develop simple representative models due to the varieties of their physical embodiments in a circuit and the creative nature of a rational human adversary. Since it is nonetheless desirable to have a mathematical framework for determining the effectiveness of hardware Trojan detection methods, we present a game theoretic framework for so doing. Modeling the Trojan maker and detection method designer as opposing players in a 2-person strategic game is a necessary step in our process. However, the ultimate utility of the approach depends on an accurate security economic model of both players that can correctly consider the players' incentives, empirically-derived detection method efficacy metrics, a comprehensive taxonomy of hardware Trojans, and the places in the design cycle of the circuit where the Trojan insertion and detection occur. In this paper, we present such a security economic model and the resulting game, which we call the Trust Game. We illustrate the value of this game primarily in the context of how it may guide the development of new hardware Trojan detection methods. We solve a representative game, illustrating the value of two common solution concepts, the iterated elimination of dominated strategies and Nash equilibrium. We further show that this framework has utility to both of the opposing players in the game. Finally, we recommend the development of standardized Trust Games that can be used to quickly measure the efficacy of both new hardware Trojans and hardware Trojan detection methods.

AB  - This paper proposes a general analytical model of surface-mounted permanent magnet (SPM) machines with series-connected coils under inter-turn short circuit (ITSC) fault. One prominent feature of this model is that the air-gap and slot-leakage components of inductances under fault are calculated separately, which consider the influences of pole number and spatial distribution of coils. In the model, winding function approach (WFA) is used to calculate the air-gap inductance components by considering all space harmonics whilst slot-leakage inductance components are obtained by using slot permeance method. The proposed faulty machine model built in Matlab/Simulink is validated by time stepping FE simulations for a 3kW 96-slot 32-pole SPM machine. The model is suitable for the fast evaluation of fault performance of SPM machines and the development of faulty model considering core saturation if necessary. Other power ratings (0.5MW and 3MW) have also been investigated to study scaling effect on machine fault-tolerant capability.

AB  - Stator copper bar is usually divided into several thin uniform strands, insulated from each other. This is done to reduce additional induced voltage due to convergence of magnetic flux from winding and rotor themselves. Flux density varies radially in density which causes different induced voltage strand to strand. To cancel out unbalanced strand voltage and minimize circulating current and resultant heating, strands are usually transposed. Transposition mechanism is fairly common, and is referred as roebelling. Manufacturing an ideal transposition is a difficult process. There is almost always some associated manufacturing defects present. Untreated issues like strand tilt leads to less utilization of material (less efficiency) &amp; also issues like partial discharge leads to heating due to voids in the insulation. Nonconformance cost incur during the operation, if issues are not corrected. Paper presents the analysis with SoS (System of Systems) approach. In a better performing system (in this case electrical generator), each of the systems (strand, roebel coil and each phase winding) should collectively work to achieve the target of overall system (i.e. more efficient generator system). There are some other issues which arises due to the strand misalignment, e.g. void in the insulation, partial discharge and slot induced eddy voltage change and are discussed in the paper. Paper presents how important is it for system to work in coordination with other systems in order for the overall system to work efficiently. Paper also presents the complexity in evaluating strand tilt during stator coil manufacturing process. A unique solution of non-destructive testing to detect strand tilt is presented which provided excellent result. This is helpful to evaluate, how off the strand is tilted at any particular location on the generator coil.

AB  - This paper explores the role of prosocial behaviour when people team up with robots in a collaborative game that presents a social dilemma similar to a public goods game. An experiment was conducted with the proposed game in which each participant joined a team with a prosocial robot and a selfish robot. During 5 rounds of the game, each player chooses between contributing to the team goal (cooperate) or contributing to his individual goal (defect). The prosociality level of the robots only affects their strategies to play the game, as one always cooperates and the other always defects. We conducted a user study at the office of a large corporation with 70 participants where we manipulated the game result (winning or losing) in a between-subjects design. Results revealed two important considerations: (1) the prosocial robot was rated more positively in terms of its social attributes than the selfish robot, regardless of the game result; (2) the perception of competence, the responsibility attribution (blame/credit), and the preference for a future partner revealed significant differences only in the losing condition. These results yield important concerns for the creation of robotic partners, the understanding of group dynamics and, from a more general perspective, the promotion of a prosocial society.

AB  - We contribute in solving the well known system-level fault diagnosis problem which main objective is to identify faulty nodes based on an input syndrome that has been generated using the asymmetric comparison model. In such a model, pairs of nodes perform tasks assigned to them and the outputs of executing these tasks are compared. Based on the matching and mismatching among the nodes' outputs, the diagnosis algorithm must identify faulty nodes. In general, it is assumed that a maximum of t of these units can simultaneously fail permanently. In this paper, we describe a new game-theory-based diagnosis algorithm, which identifies the faulty nodes by maximizing the payoffs of all players (nodes). The novel approach has been implemented and evaluated using randomly generated diagnosable systems. The simulation results showed that the new game-theory-based diagnosis algorithm was able to identify all faulty situations, making it a viable addition to existing diagnosis algorithms.

AB  - Cadmium Telluride (CdTe) detectors have excellent detection efficiency for high-energy photons. However, various types of defects in the bulk impair their performance. The effect of the defects can be studied using laser Transient Current Technique. By combining the technique with raster scanning, and by utilizing various imaging techniques, the defects can be classified and their impact to the detector operation can be estimated. By varying the laser focus, power, and the detector bias, different effects can be studied. In this contribution, we study defects in CdTe pad detectors by raster scanning the detector surfaces with 660 nm and 1064 nm lasers.

AB  - Aiming at the problem that it is difficult to accurately locate and identify the defects of anti-vibration hammer components in high-voltage transmission lines, this paper propose a detection method for anti-vibration hammer defects based on the improved Cascade R-CNN algorithm. In dataset: Firstly, this research construct a dataset of anti-vibration hammer defects based on common anti-vibration hammer defect categories; secondly, this research perform preprocessing methods such as cropping, flipping, gamma transformation and CLAHE on training samples to improve the generalization ability of the network and avoid over-fitting. In algorithm: This research use ResNeXt-101 as the backbone network of the Cascade R-CNN algorithm; add FPN module for extracting multi-scale features to extract more effective information; use Focal Loss function to improve the classification loss of RPN module to solve the dataset category imbalance problem. Experimental results show that the improved Cascade R-CNN algorithm has a detection accuracy of 91.2% on the anti-vibration hammer defect test set, which is 3.5% higher than the original Cascade R-CNN algorithm and is better than other mainstream object detection algorithms.

AB  - Detection of open live conductors is a challenging task in the power system operation since it acts as a high impedance fault. High impendence faults (HIF) characteristically has a very low current value which is often not detectable using conventional over current protection devices. Several methods of detecting these HIF have been put forward. These methods involve spectral analysis of currents, algorithms based on residual current analysis and detection of unbalanced voltages produced by the fault at the end of distribution line. This paper presents a method of detecting open conductor faults based on the sequence current component. Here the ratio of negative sequence current to positive sequence current is used as the detecting parameter and fault is detected through the unbalanced resulted in the system with the occurrence of the fault.

AB  - To carefully describe the mechanical condition information from transformer acoustic signals and then identify its typical mechanical faults, the combination of gammatone filter cepstral coefficient (GFCC) time-frequency graph of acoustic signals and Convolution Neural Network is proposed in this paper when considered the excellent sound recognition ability of human auditory system. The gammatone filterbank is first used to decompose the acoustic signals frequency of power transformer with the abundant samples of GFCC time-frequency diagram obtained. Then the intrinsic features of transformer acoustic signal GFCC time-frequency diagram samples are extracted by AlexNet convolution neural network, which is used as input of classifier for recognition. The calculated results of acoustic signals under normal and typical mechanical faults of a 10 kV dry-type transformer have shown that the proposed mechanical fault model of transformer has good recognition effect with mechanical fault model of transformer. The accuracy can reach more than 98%. The research results can provide an important basis for sound diagnosis of typical mechanical faults of power transformers.

AB  - This paper investigates the connection between network reliability and security by modeling attacker-defender interactions as a game. We model the defender's network as an undirected graph with insecure and unreliable edges. The edges could either fail due to a random malfunction (fault), or due to a strategic attacker who aims to maximize the defender's loss (attack). In many environments, the defender faces prohibitive costs of isolating the type of failures, i.e., fault versus attack. In addition, delays in arrival of diagnostic information to the defender may prevent him to detect the type of failure. To account for such information deficiencies, we let the defender know only the relative frequencies of failures with different types. From our analysis, equilibrium depends on these relative frequencies, and on the exogenously given probability distribution of reliability failures on the edges. Thus, in presence of the aforementioned information deficiencies, reliability and security are interdependent, and we argue that defenders (managers) should co-design their defenses against faults and attacks.

AB  - Infrared image possess the characteristics of large noises, concentrated intensity, blurring target edge, and poor contrast between target and background, which causing the segmentation of damage targets in aircraft skin infrared thermal image become difficult. Aiming at this problem, a method of infrared image segmentation based on the game between Markov Random Field (MRF) and improved Gradient Vector Flow (GVF) Snake is proposed in this paper. On the basis of wavelet transform denoising, the infrared image is firstly classified into target and background domain by Maximum Between-Class Variance. Secondly, region-based MRF image segmentation model and edge-based improved GVF Snake image segmentation model are established, respectively. These two algorithms are executed in parallel and independently, and the iteration stops when convergence condition is reached. Finally, Game theory is applied to fuse the segmentation results of the above two models. When the game reaches the Nash equilibrium, the optimal solution of segmentation is acquired. The experimental results show that the proposed method can successfully segment the defect targets from the infrared images of aircraft aluminum skin specimens and effectively improve the accuracy of infrared image segmentation.

AB  - Contemporary video games are generally designed with the aim of engendering a state of immersion in their players. A sense of 'presence' is considered to be a prerequisite of total immersion, the ultimate level of immersion, and can be directly related to the degree of realism in the simulation presented in a videogame. However, continuously increasing the degree of visual realism in an image could cause adverse effects such as fault amplification and more importantly, emotions like fear and dread of the uncanny. It can also substantially raise the development costs of a game. Consequently, videogame developers would benefit greatly from knowing the threshold beyond which increased realism is counter-productive. This paper details the development of an image processing system that measures the degree of realism of an image using three methods - gradient variance, color variance and shadow softness - derived from existing theories and practices in perceptual psychology, photoforensics and image processing. It then discusses testing of the system on a variety of photographic and video game images.

AB  - In event-based systems, safety properties are critical requirements to prevent the system from bad things happen. However, safety properties may be violated because of the runtime system functional fault. From the viewpoint of a self-adaptive system, such a system should be requirement-aware and changes its behavior to satisfy the designed requirements as much as possible. The previous work proposed a method to analyze possible adaptation options with degrading different requirements. Here, we propose an efficient difference analysis algorithm to shorten the analysis time so that the adaptation to functional fault can be more timely. Our idea is to reuse the analysis result of development time and re-analyze the changed part only, instead of performing the complete analysis from scratch. We evaluated our algorithm's efficiency based on three case studies: a coalmine pump-control system, a cyber-physical security people-flow restriction system, and a factory production cell system. The experiment results indicate that our algorithm averagely reduces 75.9% of analysis time compared with the existing analysis technique.

This mechanism developed an optimal probability distribution method so as to minimize the average trading price, used the information disturbance of probability to affect the learning ability of generators and weaken theirs market power behavior.

A structural information method is developed here that describes the successive stages of the algorithms necessary for structural information processing in the devices, through a formal presentation of information about the network. Following this, a description is given of the information structures of transients in the network and high voltage equipment networks. A numerical evaluation is carried out of the sufficiency of the amount of signal information for automatic decision-making on disconnecting a damaged network segment. The task is set in a series of previous works, based on the results achieved in improving recognition algorithms and structures of protection devices against single-phase earth faults in networks with a Petersen coil. This article proposes a numerical definition of the equilibrium point between selectivity and blocking using game theory. A comparison is given of the results and the published solution using dynamic functional modelling.

AB  - In recent years, the manufacturing industry of distribution transformer (DT) in China has developed rapidly with high competition. Since the pass rates of National Surveillance Sampling in China (NSSC) for DTs keep a low level, the quality is worried. During the 13th Five-Year Plan period, the investment of distribution network construction will reach 1.7 trillion RMB, which makes a big market for DTs. It is significant to study on optimization of sampling inspection mode and strategy, which can improve the efficiency, quality level, and the reliability of power supply. The research status and theory of sampling inspection are analyzed. The sampling action mechanism is analyzed based on game theory, where the quality cost theory is put forward. The quality cost model with zero-defect is analyzed. The key factors of the sampling inspection for DT are analyzed, including the risk, maneuverability, and economics of the test item. The optimization method of sampling inspection mode is proposed, where three sampling inspection modes are given out. The strategy with dynamic adjustment is put forward. The index system of sampling inspection is designed, which can reflect the efficiency objectively. Finally, the method is verified by the real examples.

AB  - this paper addresses, for the first time, the open-switch fault detection in a single-phase five-level packed U-cell inverter (PUC5). The proposed detection and isolation method is based on the analysis of only the output voltage signature. This latter reveals a specific distortion caused by the faulty switch. Its identification is achieved upon the location of the distortion within the fundamental period of the output voltage. Numerical simulations and experimental tests confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting open-switch faults in the PUC5 inverter.

AB  - With more and more utilities working towards deployment of new Distribution Management Systems (DMS), data availability and reliability have become an imminent requirement for their success. A DMS is only as good as the data that is fed into it, and defective data can lead to inaccurate calculations and produce low quality results in advanced power applications, such as load flow, fault analysis and protection coordination. Therefore, there is an ever-present requirement for a data repository that can hold the list of all devices and their respective attributes not only entirely, but also accurately. This goal can be fulfilled using a Geographic Information System (GIS) that can store not only the precise location of the devices in the system but also variety of data associated to each device. GIS is traditionally used to support Outage Management Systems (OMS), but with accurate component data, it can be easily expanded to supplement a DMS as well. The goal of this paper is to explain the steps involved in a successful integration of GIS data into DMS. These steps include data gap analysis, data capturing for unavailable or lost data, DMS-GIS interface, static and dynamic validations, and testing. Finally, DMS application results will be demonstrated for a test system with and without accurate data to demonstrate the strong dependency of DMS on GIS data.

AB  - In recent years, the government sampling test pass rates of the DT were not high. The quality of the DT was worried, which brings serious risks to the security and stability operation. It has important significance to study on effective quality control method of the DT. The main quality defects and reasons of the DTs during the sampling test are introduced. The sampling test theory is studied based on the game theory. The key factors of the sampling test effect are analyzed. The method of establishing quality information system of DTs based on life cycle theory is proposed, which includes production, installation, operation and maintenance process. The DT's quality control method based on life cycle information and sampling test is study on. The method is verified by the DT sampling test example of the power grid enterprise. The key sampling test items of the DT are given out based on the effect analysis.

AB  - In the automatic analysis of a tennis game, it is important to detect some anomalous match events, such as "fault serve" and "ball out", as these events are crucial in understanding the progress of a game. Audio information can be used to detect these events, but it is unreliable, because of the acoustic mismatch between the training and the test data and interfering noise caused by spectator applause, players' yells etc. We present a framework to detect these events in which audio and visual information are used both separately and in combination. We accumulate audio evidence for anomalous events that is based on audio event classification and pitch estimation, and combine this with video evidence based on scene segmentation (itself based on audio ball-hit detection) and estimation of the ball's trajectory. To evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of our approach, we test it on three different tennis matches. Results show that our approach outperforms several audio-based baselines: the best performance is an F-score of 61% on the test data.

AB  - Deep learning approaches have provided relevant contributions to electrical network fault detection and classification. Nevertheless, few works of literature exist on fault detection and classification using deep learning approaches. Fault detection using deep learning is a challenge due to the presence of legacy monitoring devices in the transmission lines, which do not allow the direct deployment of the model. Deep learning involves training of the system, thus sufficient amount of data is required. The challenge arises in acquiring appropriate data from low voltage network that could accurately be used to model the network. This study provides an analysis of fault detection and classification in the electrical secondary distribution network using the Recurrent Neural Network approach. The model was developed using the dataset obtained from the utility company in Tanzania (TANESCO), between the year 2012 and 2019. The data was obtained from the Automatic Meter Reading installed in a low voltage distribution transformer where the voltage, current, and power values were captured after every 20 minutes. The results revealed that the accuracy is more than 90%, which proves the suitability and relevance of deep learning for fault detection and classifications in the secondary distribution network. Deep learning approaches are still in the industry; hence remain the focus for the new researches to explore its usefulness in different applications.

AB  - This paper provides a study using Electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate the brain activity during code comprehension tasks. Three different code complexity levels according to five complexity metrics were considered. The use of EEG for this purpose is relevant, since the existing studies were mostly focused on neuroimaging techniques. Using Leave-One-Subject-Out cross-validation procedure for 30 subjects, it was found that the features related with the Gamma activity were the most common in all the folds. Regarding the brain regions, right parietal was the most frequent region contributing with more features. A Linear Discriminant Analysis Classifier for task classification, obtained a F-Measure of 92.71% for Code complexity easy, 52.25% for Code complexity intermediate and 53.13% for Code complexity advanced, revealing an evidence of mental effort saturation with the code complexity degree. This suggests that current code complexity metrics do not capture cognitive load and might not be the best approach to assess bug risk.

AB  - This paper presents an investigation on the behavior of a full-converter-based wind power plant (FCWPP) during short-circuits. To do so, an actual power network is taken into account, in which a transmission line that connects a FCWPP to a traditional system fed by typical high inertia generation units is studied. The test system was modeled and tested by means of Electromagnetic Transients Programs (EMTP), namely Alternative Transients Program (ATP) and Power System Simulator (PS SIMUL). Single-phase fault scenarios at different positions on the studied line were tested and then, voltage and current characteristics at both terminals were investigated. The obtained results show that the FCWPP control leads voltages and currents to present different patterns from those verified when typical synchronous machines are considered, which can impair monitoring functions or even interfere disturbance analysis studies.

AB  - This paper proposes new optimization techniques to obtain optimal values of Time Multiplier Setting (TMS) for directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) in a protection scheme. General Algebraic Modelling System (GAMS) and CVX modelling system for convex optimization are the new techniques proposed. TMS of DOCRs needs to be accurately determined in order to coordinate the operating time and avert the mal-operation of the backup relays in the transmission and distribution network. Without optimum coordination of the action of relays, fault conditions will trip healthy transmission lines and might lead to a total shut down of the grid. The time coordination of relays in a network is an extremely constrained optimization function which identified as a linear programming problem (LPP). Of late, the use of genetic algorithm (GA) for DOCRs coordination have become increasingly prominent. Therefore, the proposed CVX and GAMS techniques are compared with conventional GA scheme. Results show that an accurate optimization solution for directional overcurrent relay coordination can be achieved using both GAMS and CVX methods in comparison to GA based method with GAMS providing a more accurate solution.
