AB  - Reliability modeling of electronic circuits can be best performed by the stressor - susceptibility interaction model. A circuit or a system is deemed to be failed once the stressor has exceeded the susceptibility limits. Complex manufacturing systems often require a high level of reliability from the incoming electricity supply. Modern industrial time power quality monitoring systems can be used for the pre-fault load alarming. Neural networks can successfully model and predict the failure frame of critical electronic systems and power utilization in power plants described only a few input quantities. Differential polynomial neural network is a new type of neural network, which constructs and substitutes an unknown general sum partial differential equation with a total sum of fractional polynomial terms. The system model describes partial relative derivative dependent changes of some input combinations of variables. This type of non-linear regression is based on trained generalized data relations decomposed by partial low order polynomials of 2-input variables. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method is efficient.

AB  - Neural Networks are currently one of the most widely deployed machine learning algorithms. In particular, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), are gaining popularity and are evaluated for deployment in safety critical applications such as self driving vehicles. Modern CNNs feature enormous memory bandwidth and high computational needs, challenging existing hardware platforms to meet throughput, latency and power requirements. Functional safety and error tolerance need to be considered as additional requirement in safety critical systems. In general, fault tolerant operation can be achieved by adding redundancy to the system, which is further exacerbating the computational demands. Furthermore, the question arises whether pruning and quantization methods for performance scaling turn out to be counterproductive with regards to fail safety requirements. In this work we present a methodology to evaluate the impact of permanent faults affecting Quantized Neural Networks (QNNs) and how to effectively decrease their effects in hardware accelerators. We use FPGA-based hardware accelerated error injection, in order to enable the fast evaluation. A detailed analysis is presented showing that QNNs containing convolutional layers are by far not as robust to faults as commonly believed and can lead to accuracy drops of up to 10%. To circumvent that, we propose two different methods to increase their robustness: 1) selective channel replication which adds significantly less redundancy than used by the common triple modular redundancy and 2) a fault-aware scheduling of processing elements for folded implementations.

AB  - As software systems play an increasingly important role in our lives, their complexity continues to increase. The increased complexity of software systems makes the assurance of their quality very difficult. Therefore, a significant amount of recent research focuses on the prioritization of software quality assurance efforts. One line of work that has been receiving an increasing amount of attention for over 40 years is software defect prediction, where predictions are made to determine where future defects might appear. Since then, there have been many studies and many accomplishments in the area of software defect prediction. At the same time, there remain many challenges that face that field of software defect prediction. The paper aims to accomplish four things. First, we provide a brief overview of software defect prediction and its various components. Second, we revisit the challenges of software prediction models as they were seen in the year 2000, in order to reflect on our accomplishments since then. Third, we highlight our accomplishments and current trends, as well as, discuss the game changers that had a significant impact on software defect prediction. Fourth, we highlight some key challenges that lie ahead in the near (and not so near) future in order for us as a research community to tackle these future challenges.

AB  - This paper introduces a novel architecture for human-machine interface focusing primarily on the human aspects as applied to aircraft and unmanned systems. There is a need to explore new human-machine interface strategies stemming from the proliferation over the past years of accidents due to system complexity, failure modes and human errors. Concepts of autonomy establish the foundational elements of the work. We pursue a rigorous systems engineering process to analyze and design the tools and techniques for automated vehicle health monitoring, human-automation interface and conflict resolution enabled by innovative methods from game theory and reasoning algorithms. The general structure is illustrated in the paper. This paper addresses the general interface framework while emphasizing the human's (pilots) intended actions following an adverse event on-board the vehicle, i.e. critical component fault/failure modes. When combined with automated health state assessment means on-board the aircraft, the proposed strategy assists to improve the reliability of estimated actions the pilot must execute to mitigate possible catastrophic consequences. A “smart” knowledge base is exploited as the reasoning paradigm where cases are stored and new ones are compared with similar ones available in the case library. Learning and adaptation tools are used to improve the decision making process. The emphasis of this contribution is on methods and tools for conflict resolution when the automated system's advisories are coincident with the human's intended actions. Appropriate similarity metrics are defined and used for this purpose. The efficacy of the approach is demonstrated via an interface built in MATLAB highlighting the performance of the algorithmic modules for assessment and conflict resolution.

AB  - This paper presents a theoretical analysis and simulation for the design and implementation of a Second Order Generalized Integrator - Frequency Locked Loop (SOGI-FLL) aimed at synchronization and fault detection when connecting an inverter to the utility grid. Such an inverter is implemented in a Highly-Efficient-and-Reliable- Inverter-Concept (HERIC) topology. The two main aims of this work are: First, the frequency and phase synchronization of the HERIC power inverter with the grid through the SOGI-FLL. Second, the detection of abnormal conditions that may occur in the coupling point system by analyzing changes in frequency, phase shifts and amplitude variations. This is done by complying with the IEEE 1547 standard for disconnecting generation systems to the grid in case of failure. Finally, from the experimental results, it can be concluded that the SOGI-FLL system is an appropriate alternative for controlling the injection of energy process into the grid, as well as for detecting possible grid faults.

AB  - Fault tolerance is an essential feature in marine and naval electric propulsion drives. Therefore, there is a growing research interest in developing fault tolerant technologies for marine applications. This paper investigates the control and operation of an inverter fed PM propulsion motor under a specific power electronic failure case. Compared to the technologies reported in literature, this paper formulates a special control strategy for the motor operation during the situation where only one high side switch and one low side switch in two different phases are operational in a standard three-phase six-switch inverter. The proposed control strategy assumes that the remaining switches are failed in open circuit while the corresponding anti-parallel diodes are functional. The mathematical background of the two quadrant control strategy is formulated. The operation is analyzed in the context of marine propulsion power/speed requirements. Simulations for a 50 kW three-phase fault tolerant motor is presented for the operation with the proposed dual switch control strategy. Controllability of motor torque for speeds up to 45% rated speed corresponding to approximately 9% rated propulsion power output is achieved without overrating the device current ratings.

AB  - The torque and flux of sinusoidally distributed multiphase machines can be controlled by using only two stator d-q components. Thus, in these machines there exist additional degrees of freedom, which in multimotor drive systems are used to independently control a group of series-connected multiphase machines. Series connected machines share stator currents, therefore it is interesting to study how harmonics produced by non-linearities, faults or imbalance of the feeding system are distributed in the two-motor system, in terms of subspaces and sequences. This paper analyzes low-order harmonic distribution and its effects in a series-connected six-phase two-motor drive through experimental results collected from a laboratory setup.

AB  - This paper presents a unified space vector modulation (SVM) algorithm for lifetime prolongation of thermally-overheated power semiconductor devices in multilevel inverters. Thermal overheating is the main cause of shortened-lifetime and open-circuit faults of the devices. Power semiconductor devices are subjected to thermal overheating due to their ageing that results from continuous overloading and power cycling. Moreover, thermal overheating in high power devices may result from its degradation and faults in the cooling system. When a thermal overheating is detected in one of the power devices, the proposed algorithm is applied to relieve the overheated device and dangerous circumstances are avoided as a result. The proposed algorithm relies on using the redundancy property between switching states in multilevel inverters to continuously evaluate a cost function of the junction temperature of thermally-overheated device for all possible switching sequences set, then it identifies the optimal relieving switching sequence. The proposed unified SVM is general that can be applied to any multilevel inverter, and also is valid for switching devices, as well as DC-link capacitors. The proposed algorithm has been designed and validated by simulation and experimental prototypes of three-level T-type inverter.

AB  - Automatic detection of Mura defects on liquid crystal display (LCD) is an important application of computer vision, an accurate and efficient approach is implemented in this paper. In the stage of image preprocess, in order to reduce the interference of the structurally textural backgrounds of the screen, we use a Gabor filter to process the noise. In the defect detection stage, aiming at the interference of uneven brightness background on Mura defect recognition, based on the principle of mask uniformity, we propose a method for estimating the brightness distribution of the screen to reconstruct the background of the screen, and do background subtraction using the built background image. Defects are detected by gamma correction and threshold segmentation of differential images. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm greatly shortens the execution time and achieves a good detection effect compared with the background reconstruction algorithm based on regression fitting.

AB  - The Electromagnetic Calorimeter (EMC) of the future PANDA detector relies on a stabile performance of the PbWO<sub>4</sub> crystals of enhanced PWO-II quality. In spite of the expected moderate radiation dose imposed by hadrons and electromagnetic probes during operation, the interplay between damaging and statistical recovery processes is strongly influenced by the low operating temperature of T=-25° C. Previous investigations have shown that relaxation mechanisms become extremely slow and the limit on the asymptotically reached light output depends on the intrinsic concentration of defect centers in the crystal. The process of stimulated recovery leads in case of damage due to γ-rays at room temperature to an almost complete recovery using even infrared light. At low temperature, the mechanism leads to a substantial recovery but on significantly longer time scales. The paper will discuss a series of detailed measurements in order to understand recovery mechanisms at low temperature and the sensitivity to different external light sources. Part of the program is EPR-based measurements to identify the population or extinction of well-known color centers. A second experimental set-up allows measuring the change of the optical transmission spectrum of a permanently cooled crystal in situ using a photo spectrometer. The transmittance over the relevant region of wavelength is controlled before and after irradiation as well as during the recovery with different external light sources. The studies of the damage due to a high flux of γ-rays are compared complementary to the impact of 90 MeV protons performed at the cyclotron at KVI (Groningen Netherlands). Up to a fluence of 6.75×10<sup>11</sup> protons/cm<sup>2</sup> protons will impinge and be completely stopped in the test samples.

In paper we analyze implementation of alpha-beta-gamma filter in Kalman model representation to reduce noise in trajectory data of aircraft. We consider sensor noise filtration of Distance Measuring Equipment and VHF omnidirectional Range as an initial data processing and noise reduction at trajectory data processing. Multiple changes of navigational aids in pairs lead to pure noise filtration of distances and angles measurements. Noise filtration at top level provides better performance of trajectory data processing in comparison with sensor data filtration.

AB  - Explaining how cooperation can emerge, and persist over time in various species is a prime challenge for both biologists and social scientists. Whereas cooperation in non-human species might be explained through mechanisms such as kinship selection or reciprocity, this is usually regarded as insufficient to explain the extent of cooperation observed in humans. It has been theorized that indirect reciprocity-I help you, and someone else later helps me-could explain the breadth of human cooperation. Reputation is central to this idea, since it conveys important information to third parties whether to cooperate or not with a focal player. In this paper we analyze a model for reputation dynamics through gossiping, and pay specific attention to the possible cooperation networks that may arise. We show that gossiping agents can organize into cooperative clusters, i.e. cooperate within clusters, and defect between them, which can be regarded as socially balanced. We also deduce conditions for these gossiping cooperators to be evolutionary stable.

AB  - API misuses are prevalent and extremely harmful. Despite various techniques have been proposed for API-misuse detection, it is not even clear how different types of API misuses distribute and whether existing techniques have covered all major types of API misuses. Therefore, in this paper, we conduct the first large-scale empirical study on API misuses based on 528,546 historical bug-fixing commits from GitHub (from 2011 to 2018). By leveraging a state-of-the-art fine-grained AST differencing tool, GumTree, we extract more than one million bug-fixing edit operations, 51.7% of which are API misuses. We further systematically classify API misuses into nine different categories according to the edit operations and context. We also extract various frequent API-misuse patterns based on the categories and corresponding operations, which can be complementary to existing API-misuse detection tools. Our study reveals various practical guidelines regarding the importance of different types of API misuses. Furthermore, based on our dataset, we perform a user study to manually analyze the usage constraints of 10 patterns to explore whether the mined patterns can guide the design of future API-misuse detection tools. Specifically, we find that 7,541 potential misuses still exist in latest Apache projects and 149 of them have been reported to developers. To date, 57 have already been confirmed and fixed (with 15 rejected misuses correspondingly). The results indicate the importance of studying historical API misuses and the promising future of employing our mined patterns for detecting unknown API misuses.

AB  - Today's Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) are being used in more exotic applications and mission critical applications. However, recent trends in current technology tend to make FPGAs less reliable. FPGA vendors have been moving down the same path of smaller device size as the rest of the semiconductor industry leading to electro migration problem and at the same time moving to larger and larger dies in order to deliver more logic gates to their customers inviting more opportunities for failure and bigger targets for gamma particles. Thus, there is a drive from the user community to improve reliability through some level of fault-tolerance. The homogeneous structure of Field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) suggests that the defect tolerance can be achieved by shifting the configuration data inside the FPGA. This paper presents a study, comparison, analysis and implementation of two available methods for swapping the configured data that is king shifting algorithm and horse shifting algorithm and further proposes a new algorithm to minimize the overall cost and improve the yield and performance parameters of system.

AB  - During the life cycle of a cyber-physical system, it is sometimes necessary to upgrade a working controller with a new, but unverified, one which provides better performance or additional functionality. To make sure that system invariants are not broken because of bugs in the new controller, an architecture is used in which both controllers are implemented on the platform, and a supervisor process checks that the actions of the new controller keep the system within its safe states. If an invariant may be violated, the supervisor switches over to the old controller that ensures correct behavior, but possibly degraded performance. A key question in the design of such supervisors is the switching strategy: when should the supervisor reinstate the new controller after it has switched to the old one? In general, one would prefer to use the new controller as much as possible, provided it does not violate safety. However, arbitrarily switching back to the new controller can cause the system to become unstable, even when each controller in isolation ensures stability. We provide a supervisor synthesis procedure that uses a simple counting strategy for the supervisor. Our synthesized supervisor ensures that switching between the controllers ensures stability of the system, while maintaining its safety properties and providing a lower bound on the use of the new controller. We prove the correctness of the strategy and show on an example that it can provide close to optimal use of the new controller against many disturbance scenarios.

AB  - JavaScript extends its uses from client-side web applications to mobile applications, but testing JavaScript applications is not yet satisfactory. Researchers have not spent much attention on testing JavaScript programs, and existing coverage metrics and testing mechanisms for C and Java may not be applicable to JavaScript because of its extremely dynamic semantics without any compile-time checks. Because, in JavaScript, any variable may have any kinds of types during evaluation, and because varying types change program execution flows, testing JavaScript programs requires more cases to cover different execution flows. Thus, test cases with 100% coverage levels in terms of the existing coverage metrics for statically typed languages may miss faults in JavaScript. Moreover, existing search strategies for statically typed languages may not exercise increased test requirements by dynamic languages effectively. In this paper, we identify JavaScript characteristics that make thorough testing of JavaScript programs more difficult than testing C and Java programs. To address such characteristics, we propose new partition-based coverage metrics that expose implicit execution flows using varying types. To generate test cases satisfying the coverage metrics effectively, we develop type-guided search strategies for concolic testing using program analysis results. We evaluate the new coverage metrics and search strategies for concolic testing with open-source web applications, and the preliminary experimental results show that their practical uses in JavaScript testing are promising.

AB  - The evolution of the World Wide Web (WWW) service has incorporated new distributed multimedia conference applications, powering a new generation of e-services development, and allowing improved interactivity. Most common interactive real-time applications are fault-tolerant but suffer from QoS limitations; low-latency requirements and reliability are cumulative to conference success, it may easily absorb all network resources and the subjective quality sensed by users would remain poor if the available resources are used indiscriminately. This paper simulates a network infrastructure design that classifies and prioritizes the real-time traffic in order to improve the performance of the real-time applications, taking into consideration of the performance of non real-time applications. This infrastructure has been designed to present a typical network of a university campus, so that in this way it can be implemented in any campus. In this paper 3 scenarios are suggested first before enabling any QoS mechanism at the routers, second use class based weighted fair queuing using low latency queue (CBWFQ-LLQ) for video traffic and last scenario apply CBWFQ-LLQ for voice. The simulation is conducted using OPNET IT Guru. Simulation results demonstrated that applying LLQ for voice improves the performance of overall real-time and non real-time application.

AB  - Boosting lifetime of power components in multilevel inverters is a major aim to enhance the total system reliability and performance. This paper presents a space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) strategy for lifetime prolongation of thermally-overloaded power devices in multilevel inverters. When a thermal overloading is detected in one of the power devices, the proposed algorithm is applied to relieve the overloaded device and therefore preventing dangerous circumstances such as open-or short-circuit faults. The proposed methodology relies on using the redundancy property between the switching states in multilevel inverters to continuously evaluate the junction temperature of the thermally-overloaded power devices for all the possible switching sequences, then it identifies the optimal relieving switching sequence. The proposed methodology is valid for both/either of the power switching devices and/or DC-link capacitors. The proposed strategy is simple, and does not require any additional hardware. Furthermore, it does not deteriorate the output power. Accordingly, lifetime and reliability of multilevel inverters have been enhanced considerably. The proposed methodology has been designed and validated by simulation and experimental prototyping of a three-level T-type inverter system to investigate its feasibility and effectiveness.

AB  - According to NFPA 70E, more than 2000 workers are admitted to hospital burn centers per year for extensive injuries caused by arc flash accidents. Arc flash incidents occur when unintended electric current flows through air, superheating the air and causes an explosion. Recognizing the significant threat posed by arc flash hazards, IEEE and NFPA have joined forces on an initiative to support research and additional testing to increase the understanding of the arc flash phenomena. Several areas of the arc flash phenomena need further research and testing validation to provide relevant information that can be used for developing safety strategies to protect workers. The identified areas include but are not limited to: (a) Heat and Thermal Effects, (b) Blast Pressure, (c) Sound and (d) Light Hazards. The test results of this project will provide information to help more accurately predict the hazards associated with high energy arcing faults, thereby improving electrical safety standards and providing practical safeguards for employees in the work place. This report highlights the activities of this collaborative research project.

AB  - Tremendous resources are being invested in arc flash studies and personal protective equipment (PPE) to protect workers from “arc flash” hazards. In the flurry to comply with OSHA regulations and NFPA 70 and 70E Standards, real understanding of the arc hazard and incident energy may be lagging behind. The term “arc flash” does not adequately convey the range of potential arc hazards - light, pressure and heat transmission, as well as others. The term “arc flash” also fails to emphasize that arc flash injuries primarily arise from thermal burns, and that the risk of a potentially severe or fatal arc burn is often present when performing electrical work. Worker risk assessment and the appropriate PPE are represented as definitive quantities in “cal/cm<sup>2</sup>;” however, the quantitative potential heat exposure and heat protection afforded by PPE are usually less precise than the assigned numerical value. Basic concepts of incident energy, PPE ratings and burn injury are also explored in this paper to help identify factors influencing the burn hazards posed by arcing faults in electrical power systems.

AB  - The protection of the symmetric cryptographic algorithm, specially the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), against fault injection attacks is very inportant to guarantee the security of transmitted data. In this paper, we proposed a new fault detection scheme based information redundancy for the AES. We analysis the detection scheme robustness against the fault injection attacks. The simulation fault attacks results prove that the fault coverage reaches 71.43%. In addition, the original and the protected AES hardware implementation have been implemented on the Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA. We confirm that the protected AES is very effective while keeping the frequency overhead very low.

AB  - Deep learning (DL) systems are widely used in domains including aircraft collision avoidance systems, Alzheimer's disease diagnosis, and autonomous driving cars. Despite the requirement for high reliability, DL systems are difficult to test. Existing DL testing work focuses on testing the DL models, not the implementations (e.g., DL software libraries) of the models. One key challenge of testing DL libraries is the difficulty of knowing the expected output of DL libraries given an input instance. Fortunately, there are multiple implementations of the same DL algorithms in different DL libraries. Thus, we propose CRADLE, a new approach that focuses on finding and localizing bugs in DL software libraries. CRADLE (1) performs cross-implementation inconsistency checking to detect bugs in DL libraries, and (2) leverages anomaly propagation tracking and analysis to localize faulty functions in DL libraries that cause the bugs. We evaluate CRADLE on three libraries (TensorFlow, CNTK, and Theano), 11 datasets (including ImageNet, MNIST, and KGS Go game), and 30 pre-trained models. CRADLE detects 12 bugs and 104 unique inconsistencies, and highlights functions relevant to the causes of inconsistencies for all 104 unique inconsistencies.

AB  - The Structural SIMilarity (SSIM) is one of the most prominent image quality assessment (IQA) methods due to its high prediction performance and wide applicability for image quality optimization problems. To reflect the luminance adaptation (LA) characteristic of human visual system (HVS), SSIM is modelled to have high consistency with Weber's law. However, it inevitably has some intrinsic faults that wrongly incorporate the LA effect into SSIM. In this paper, we firstly analyze that Weber's law in the conventional SSIM index cannot precisely reflect the LA effect due to two reasons: (i) it is reported that Weber's law model is not able to precisely be fitted in the measured experimental results for the LA effect; (ii) SSIM is calculated with pixel intensity values, but Weber's law is applied for luminance values which have non-linear relations with the pixel intensity values. To solve this problem, we first theoretically derive a new LA effect model in pixel intensity domain using a Gamma correction function and a power-law model. We then devise a weight function for the LA effect, called LA-based local weight function (LALF) which allows the proposed LA effect model to be precisely incorporated into SSIM index. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed LALF-based SSIM, we perform comprehensive experiments on four large IQA databases. Experimental results show that the proposed LALF helps performance improvement of the SSIM index.

AB  - Human brains tend to assign meanings to all objects and doings around. Not all constructions applied during these processes are correct. They then result in mistakes, confusions or misconceptions. Today, the Internet is often used as a medium for spreading such unsound information generally described as “fake news” or “conspiracy theories”. If we do not want our students to be overwhelmed by them, we have to search for methods helping them to disclose common logical failures and delusions. To do so, the author demonstrates to his learners how easily false information can be produced by hiding and/or modifying regular information. To disclose errors in this type of information, one has to find missing or misinterpreted pieces using a similar approach - to analyze its input elements, their robustness and relevance and then to study correctness of the process of their combination and reasoning. Our aim is to point to the moments which can decide whether person's thinking is of high quality. In our presentation, we present our approach by a series of examples demonstrating nonsenses and absurd statements in Mathematics. Maths is often presented as a “magic wand” for developing critical thinking skills. We show that the relationship between mathematics and critical thinking is more complex. The problem lies in the ambiguity of natural language. By showing differences and discrepancies between the two, the learners may recognize the most frequent faults and become capable to disclose their own fallacies. This ability should become an integral part of their critical thinking weaponry.The simplicity, transparency and humorous character of our examples attracts students to participate in an intellectual game which covers all aspects of total quality framework: credibility, analyzability, transparency and usefulness. Our presented problems may inspire other educators to generate their own “nonsenses” specific for their courses in order to build a solid and structured basis for their disciplines.

AB  - This paper describes the design of a MIMO H-infinity gain schedule for the Meridian UAS and illustrates its application for an extended operational range and for a moderate fault tolerant capability. The gain scheduling concept is based on smooth interpolation between two H-infinity controllers, covering a broad range of trim conditions. This interpolation is provided by the homogeneous design of the controllers by using the same augmented model structure within the H-infinity algorithm. The scheduling variable is defined as the commanded airspeed, acting as an exogenous variable, driving a smooth transition between the current and the next controller. The utilization of an exogenous signal avoids the occurrence of hidden coupling effects, typical in gain scheduling applications. Also, a new procedure is defined to adapt the controller when a failure or a significant dynamic change in the UAS takes place. Using the best knowledge of the failure the H-infinity controller is calculated. This controller is computed with a predefined gamma value, avoiding iterations, generating the new controller instantaneously.

Our objective is to educate senior undergraduate Software Engineering students on the design, verification and implementation of fault tolerance in Parallel and Distributed Computing (PDC) systems. Towards this end, we design three course modules that include several lectures, demonstrations and homework assignments. We implement these course modules based on a discovery-based method of teaching where students are required (individually and in groups) to solve problems by modeling, simulating and verifying models of FTPDC systems. The students' performances and their feedback show that the designed course modules for the modeling and automated analysis of FTPDC have significantly helped them to understand the basic concepts of FTPDC and explore more advanced concepts. We will improve the design of the third course module to enhance students' skills in the implementation of fault-tolerance mechanisms.

AB  - Conventional power systems are transitioning to smart grids for remote control, reduced losses and auto correction of system faults. An energy management system for smart grids based on renewable sources is critical due to the intermittent nature of output power from these sources and variability of the load demands, which yield voltage and frequency fluctuations. This study analyses the superiority of smart grids based on power electronic transformers. P-F droop control method and Q-V droop method have been used for frequency and voltage rectification respectively. MATLAB simulations were run and the results show the hybridized smart grid has better stability as compared to stand-alone systems. The optimization method used is hybrid particle swarm and grey wolf due to its faster convergence performance and fast implementation process. The study finds that implementation of the management strategy modeled would result in 100% load supply and hence stability of the power system.

AB  - This paper presents Clio, an approach that detects modularity violations, which can cause software defects, modularity decay, or expensive refactorings. Clio computes the discrepancies between how components should change together based on the modular structure, and how components actually change together as revealed in version history. We evaluated Clio using 15 releases of Hadoop Common and 10 releases of Eclipse JDT. The results show that hundreds of violations identified using Clio were indeed recognized as design problems or refactored by the developers in later versions. The identified violations exhibit multiple symptoms of poor design, some of which are not easily detectable using existing approaches.

AB  - Computed tomography (CT) greatly improves the image information available to surgeons and is quickly becoming one of the most important methods to identify defects in patients. However, doctors must check these CT slices again and again to find the exact position of the problem. This is not only a waste of time but also highly inefficient. This paper presents a rapid process to reconstruct three-dimensional (3D) surfaces from two-dimensional (2D) CT scanned data. Based on geometric model reconstruction, a series of 2D CT image slices were read and transformed into profiles and 3D B-spline patch models were then generated. The data could be converted to a VRML format for virtual surgical applications. An actual rapid prototyping model was created for checking the design process. CT images of a human pelvic bone and skull mask were used as case studies to construct a 3D solid model from medical images. The actual model will allow doctors to observe CT slices in 3D, decrease training time, and provide references for medical image research.

AB  - Following Baryshnikov-Coffman-Kwak [2], we use cyclic network automata (CNA) to generate a decentralized protocol for dynamic coverage problems in a sensor network, with only a small fraction of sensors awake at every moment. This paper gives a rigorous analysis of CNA and shows that waves of awake-state nodes automatically solve pusuit/evasion-type problems without centralized coordination. As a corollary of this work, we unearth some interesting topological interpretations of features previously observed in cyclic cellular automata (CCA). By considering CCA over networks and completing to simplicial complexes, we induce dynamics on the higher-dimensional complex. In this setting, waves are seen to be generated by topological defects with a nontrivial degree (or winding number). The simplicial complex has the topological type of the underlying map of the workspace (a subset of the plane), and the resulting waves can be classified cohomologically. This allows one to “program” pulses in the sensor network according to cohomology class. We give a realization theorem for such pulse waves.

AB  - The quality of software engineering has always been of high importance for many actors. With the complexity of the platforms and its components, this is nowadays becoming crucial at each level in order to detect the eventual defects. Due to that complexity, the current measurement and analysis processes become heavier. Indeed, either for runtime monitoring, QoE, mobile gaming or simply for systems development, the software measurements tasks have to be fine-grained, 'greenable' and distributed. This work aims at improving the software monitoring processes and its analysis. Based on a learning-aided analysis, we intend to suggest and select metrics that should be applied at runtime to increase the quality of the measurement plan and to target metrics that could raise relevant information on the measureand. Our approach proposes a data model that allows highlighting the monitored activity of a characteristic according to the data values of the model. We focus on complex metrics that are formally modeled using the OMG standard SMM. Some experiments are performed to exemplify our methodology.

AB  - Partial Reconfiguration allows the time-multiplexing resources to be explored, accomplishing requirements such as adaptability, robustness, power consumption, cost, and also fault tolerance. This paper presents a new partial reconfiguration toolkit called RTRLib that aims to simplify the development of dynamically reconfigurable systems, consequently reducing the development time. The RTRLib is a platform-based high-level modeling tool for run-time reconfigurable systems based on the semi-formal refinement-by-replacement methodology used to simulate and analyze the system behavior during the reconfiguration process. The RTRLib also automatically provides the Vivado and SDK scripts, under some restrictions. Since RTRLib is based on previous characterized IP-cores, it is possible to have an earlier estimation of the reconfiguration time and the reconfigurable partitions resource utilization during the design process. The proposed solution allows the designer to construct the partial reconfiguration solution to be mapped on FPGA-based System-on-Chips by a simple system specification and parametrization.

AB  - To test a Software Product Line (SPL), the test artifacts and the techniques must be extended to support variability. In general, when new SPL products are developed, more tests are generated to cover new or modified features. A dominant source of extra effort for such tests is the concretization of newly generated tests. Thus, minimizing the amount of new nonconcretized tests required to perform conformance testing on new products reduces the overall test effort. In this paper, we propose a test reuse strategy for conformance testing of SPL products that aims at reducing test effort. We use incremental test generation methods based on finite state machines (FSMs) to maximize test reuse. We combine these methods with a selection algorithm used to identify non-redundant concretized tests. We illustrate our strategy using examples and a case study with an embedded mobile SPL. The results indicate that our strategy can save up to 36% of test effort in comparison to current test reuse strategies for the same fault detection capability.

AB  - Large collections of data help evolve deep learning into the state-of-the-art in solving many artificial intelligence problems. However, the requirements engineering (RE) community has yet to adapt to such sweeping changes caused exclusively by data. One reason is that the traditional requirements quality like unambiguity becomes less applicable to data, and so do requirements fault detection techniques like inspections. In this paper, we view deep learning as a class of machines whose effects must be evaluated with direct consideration of inherent data quality attributes: accuracy, consistency, currentness, etc. We substantiate this view by altering stationarity of the multivariate time-series data, and by further analyzing how the stationarity changes affect the behavior of a recurrent neural network in the context of predicting combined sewer overflow. Our work sheds light on the active role RE plays in deep learning.

AB  - Today's vehicles are evolving towards smart cars, which will be able to drive autonomously and adapt to changing contexts. Incorporating self-adaptation in these cyber-physical systems (CPS) promises great benefits, like cheaper software-based redundancy or optimised resource utilisation. As promising as these advantages are, a respective proportion of a vehicle's functionality poses as safety hazards when confronted with fault and failure situations. Consequently, a system's safety has to be ensured with respect to the availability of multiple software applications, thus often resulting in redundant hardware resources, such as dedicated backup control units. To benefit from self-adaptation by means of creating efficient and safe systems, this work introduces a safety concept in form of a generic adaptation mechanism (GAM). In detail, this generic adaptation mechanism is introduced and analysed with respect to generally known and newly created safety hazards, in order to determine a minimal set of system properties and architectural limitations required to safely perform adaptation. Moreover, the approach is applied to the ICT architecture of a smart e-car, thereby highlighting the soundness, general applicability, and advantages of this safety concept and forming the foundation for the currently ongoing implementation of the GAM within a real prototype vehicle.

AB  - Multistage interconnection networks (MINs) are used as a fast and efficient communication medium for interconnecting the elements of a multiprocessor system which mainly includes processors and memories. The reliability in these networks is an important aspect. In this paper, a new method is proposed to increase the reliability of fault-tolerant multistage interconnection networks which are based on shuffle exchange network (SEN) and shuffle exchange gamma interconnection network (SEGIN). In fact, by adding some extra multiplexers (MUX) and demultiplexers (DeMUX) in the first and last stages of these networks, the number of paths between each source-destination pair increases that results in higher reliability compared to previous networks. Moreover, theses extra modules construct a bypass path for each source or destination node that leads to decrease the single point of failure probability in comparison with the previous networks. The proposed networks are analyzed and evaluated compared to similar fault-tolerant networks based on the reliability aspects and hardware cost.

AB  - Machine learning (ML) has been penetrating into our daily life by facilitating many daily applications, e.g., self-driving, cloud gaming, product fault detection and drones. Meanwhile, there is an emerging trend that adopts ML methods into network optimization problems, such as flow classification, traffic engineering, routing, and etc. Conventional ML methods need careful training for a specific application of a given network structure, and the trained model normally cannot be applied to other applications and network structures. In this paper, we aim to design adaptive ML methods for network optimization problems, with the trained models having the ability of being deployed to any similar problems. In particular, we consider the virtualized network function (VNF) provisioning problem as our target optimization problem. We first propose a deep Q-learning-based optimization framework for VNF provisioning in a mobile edge network with network capacity constraints, by devising an adaptive graph feature embedding method. We then propose a series of deep Q-learning based learning algorithms for the problems of service chaining and the throughput maximization, based on the proposed learning-based optimization framework. We also propose a novel design of master-slave dual neural network that enables the decisions on both cloudlet selections and routing path finding. To stabilize and accelerate the convergence of the proposed methods, we devise a novel environment generation and termination strategy and a new structure for the replay buffer. We also evaluate the performance of the proposed framework and algorithms by extensive simulations. Results show that the proposed algorithms outperform existing methods by around 12%, and the trained model in a network can be directly adapted to other network structures and settings.

AB  - Chronic hyperglycemia of diabetes may lead to failure in various organs, especially the blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, nerves and heart. It happens due to the faults either in insulin secretion, insulin action, or both. As diabetes developed, the vision of patient starts to deteriorate, leading to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR). Microaneurysm (MA) are the earliest sign of DR where it appears in clusters as tiny, dark red spots or tiny hemorrhages-like within the retina light-sensitive area. Thus, the objectives of this study are to develop an automated algorithm to perform early detection of MA presence in fundus images, and to evaluate the performance of the proposed system design by evaluating the accuracy of the segmented MA. The methods involved in the pre-processing stage are the green component extraction and bottom hat filtering with gamma correction. As the characteristics of blood vessel and MA are the same, the extraction of vessels is needed. This is done by applying the Gaussian matched filter. It is then segmented out by using certain threshold value. In template learning, wavelet coefficient is used in separating the pattern and background image by following the Gaussian distribution curve. Texture energy filter is used to extract the true features where MA are identified. As a result, 84.15% of accuracy is obtained.

AB  - The ongoing decommissioning of conventional power plants decreases the installed reactive power reserves for voltage control in transmission grids. Hence, an efficient planning of compensation devices substituting this lack of reactive power is required. Grid operators must allocate these devices for steady-state voltage control and for dynamic voltage control ensuring voltage stability. A separate determination of this static and dynamic VAR demand, however, fails to exploit synergies and disregards that VAR compensation in steady-state reduces the reserves for dynamic compensation. This paper proposes a coupled determination of the system static and dynamic VAR demand. An optimisation method applying mixed-integer programming identifies an efficient allocation and portfolio consisting of different compensation technologies. It includes constraints for voltage limits during steady-state and contingencies as well as for long-term voltage stability. Results emphasise that the method identifies an efficient portfolio for various operation and fault scenarios, while providing the required voltage stability margin.

AB  - The market trend of global TV industry is nourished due to recent advancements in optical component technology and user expectations. Due to strong market requirement for slimmer mechanical designs (&lt;;10mm) and increased luminance (700nit), higher color gamut (DCI: 120%); Decreasing Backlight Unit (BLU) thickness while increasing the image quality resulted in a factor of 3 increase in volumetric heat generation rates. Heat generated by LED packages is the primary cause of defects and deformations in the LED TV optical components. TV manufacturers have then faced challenging thermal design issues. Therefore, the thermal design for a BLU must be well understood to develop a novel optic-thermal design. In this study, an approach for the thermal management of an LED TV system is developed to determine local temperature distribution over BLU and electronics. A hybrid analytical and CFD modeling approach followed by an experimental validation has been developed. First, an idealized one dimensional resistance network is created. Then, 3D CFD models of the LED TV are developed by utilizing commercial software. CFD results are then validated with the experimental data performed in a controlled thermal chamber. The test data is compared with CFD findings. A variation of 6.3% is found between numerical and experimental findings.

AB  - 3D digital models are used in a wide range of applications such as computer games, virtual reality, engineering and urban design. A common method to create 3D models is to create a point cloud using laser scanners, structured lighting sensors, or image-based modelling techniques, and from that construct a 3D mesh. The resulting meshes often exhibit unsatisfactory and erroneous mesh regions, e.g. due to inaccessible parts, reflective surfaces, and occlusion. In this paper we present a new approach for correcting erroneous mesh regions in blocky objects, such as buildings, using self-similarities. Our system uses a novel graph-based search technique where each node is a plane fitted to the model using RANSAC and edges are made between adjacent planes. This graph is used to find defects in a mesh by analysing the planes and neighbourhoods of all nodes in the point cloud. The system recognizes a hole in the mesh and fills it by copying matching patches from the same mesh. Regions of the mesh that must be replaced are found by a voting system where dissimilar nodes with a similar neighbourhood vote against each other. Our solution produces visually accurate models of blocky objects with holes and/or missing corners and edges. The approach currently only works for simple models and can only “heal” individual or connected faces, rather than complex holes. However, in contrast to existing solutions it works with noisy point clouds and does not require the construction of a polygonal modal.

AB  - Careful design and planning is essential for successful integration of energy storage system (ESS) in a shipboard dc hybrid power system. An optimization model for resiliency enhancement and total cost reduction is proposed in this paper. The resilience of a shipboard power system with and without ESS are evaluated by means of resiliency index values under fault conditions. Furthermore, the influence of ESS on total cost is analyzed quantitatively. A detailed design of ESS is carried out, and optimal ESS configurations with different device combinations for various requirements are determined. Both single-node static and dynamic planning strategies are evaluated and the principles of planning strategy selection are discussed. Several key results are presented from the optimization model, built on General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) platform. Simulation results show significant improvement from the proposed design and planning of ESS on shipboard dc hybrid power system.

AB  - With rapid proliferation of internet and advancement in video streaming techniques, demand for video content over the internet is on the rise. In this era of digital transformation the end user consumption of video content, is not just limited to conventional television sets, but extends to multiple viewing platforms like laptops, mobile phones, tablets, connected TVs, gaming consoles etc. As the demand for video content increases it becomes incumbent for the technology providers to devise a robust assurance framework to ensure best viewer experience. With a paradigm shift in end user viewing patterns, the need of the hour is to devise innovative assurance solutions to cater to the changing perceptions of video quality. In this paper we present a holistic video assurance framework, which focuses on reliable and consistent last mile end user Quality of Experience (QoE). The proposed framework uses established statistical techniques to predict optimum testing time, test cycles &amp; realistic device mix, required to validate video quality against available industry benchmarks for reliability and consistency of user experience. The proposed framework also uses automated techniques to capture, compare and report potential defects which may impact video quality consistency across multi-media platforms before it is consumed by actual end-users. The framework is found to yield highly accurate assurance levels for consistency of video content.

AB  - The inter-turn insulations of inverter-fed motor and some wind turbine generator usually suffer repetitive impulse voltage with high magnitude and steep edges. It may result in a significant reduction of life-time in case of the existence of inter-turn insulation defects. Based on the previous work with an established test system consisting of auxiliary impulse induction units and novel non-contact partial discharge (PD) sensor, this research continuously focuses on the signal processing technique and feature extraction method in inter-turn void defect diagnosis for inverter-fed traction motor winding. The singular values of characteristic matrix, which is constructed by wavelet packet decomposition of sensor’s response signal, have been proved sensitive to the PD-related information and qualified for determining the existence of inter-turn PD activity. In order to achieve the inter-turn PD feature extraction in detail, a time-domain signal processing method of PD pulses identification and segmentation has also been proposed. The statistical analysis on the inter-turn PD pulse signals which were picked out from the sensor responses in reduplicative measurements show that, the PD amplitude and time-lag are generally gamma distributed, while their per-unit values are beta distributed. In fact, the parameters of those statistical distributions are able to reflect the characteristic of inter-turn void defect under certain impulse voltage. Therefore, a method based on Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (K-S test) is proposed in order to diagnose the severity of the inter-turn void defect.

AB  - In modern distribution grids, accessing the growing amount of data from various sources, running complex algorithms on-demand, and controlling sparse actuators represent important requirements. These can be achieved with on-demand scalability to support fluctuating workloads. A possibility to provide on-demand scalability is cloud computing. This paper presents a cloud-based platform that analyzes power distribution grids data and deploys a service restoration application for the re-energization of loads after electrical faults. The implementation of this study is powered by FIWARE, which is based on open-source and customizable building blocks of future internet applications and services. The feasibility of the service restoration application is evaluated through analysis of its network latency and computation time in different test cases.

AB  - Hand defects will hinder human activities in interacting. In general, people with hand defects will replace the function of the hand with doing an activity in other organs, such as the feet, head, or eyes. Eye movement technologies have been used for different purposes in various industries, from medical, gaming, controlling display menu to assistive technology for people with disabilities. The development of new technologies focused on disability is vital as it improves the quality of life and incorporation into society. Therefore, eye movement detection can later be developed to select menus from the LCD screen. Detection of eye movements is divided into four classes, namely looking up, down, left, and right. The menu on the LCD screen contains options of activities such as calling the nurse, choosing a food menu, and going to the toilet, making it easier for nurses to understand the user's activities. This system is made using Histogram Oriented Gradient combining with Haar Cascade for eye detection and K-Nearest Neighbors as a classifier. Finally, this work shows that the KNN can be used to classify with an average accuracy of 83.33%.

AB  - The solar cells efficiency depends mainly on the energy of the absorbed photons. This energy is directly related to the crystalline properties of the semiconductor materials used like absorber. So, the absorption can be optimized using new solar cell structures based on thin film materials that absorb more photons. Therefore, using the graded CIGS like thin film materials with: high reduced thickness, optimal gap makes it possible to the solar cell to absorb a wider photon of the incident light spectrum. In the present work, exploiting SCAPS-1D simulator, we analyze the effect of the P-CIGS band gap grading profiles (Ga-composition) on the electrical performances of thin film solar cell. The simulated structure is as 1.0 μm-graded-CIGS/10 nmN-CdS/150 nmN-ZnO. We consider also in this study, the effect of defects, light spectrum and doping concentration of the absorber layer. An optimal efficiency of 22.92 % is recorded for a linear grading profile under 600 nm incident light spectrum.

AB  - Insulation piercing connector (IPC) is widely used as a link fitting for the insulated conductor in distribution network. However, there are most accidents in recent years due to installation, operation, etc. In this paper, the structure of the IPC is analyzed. The IPCs with the typical defect were prepared, including the insufficient contact force, the loose connection, the grease loss, the dampness, and the overload operation and the experimental platform based on UHF partial discharge was built. Obtained results show that the standard installed IPC has the obvious partial discharge, whose amplitude can reach 110 mV and discharge mainly concentrates on the alpha and the gamma quadrant. The defects obviously increase the PD amplitude and have a great influence on the PD characteristic, including the discharge quadrant, times and PRPS. In actual operation, this detection method could be adopted to diagnose the IPC with defect to prevent failure and improve power supply reliability.

AB  - Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) have moved from being dedicated devices for multimedia and gaming applications to general-purpose accelerators employed in High-Performance Computing (HPC) and safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. This market shift led to a burst in the GPU's computing capabilities and efficiency, significant improvements in the programming frameworks and performance evaluation tools, and a concern about their hardware reliability. In this paper, we compare and combine high-energy neutron beam experiments that account for more than 13 million years of natural terrestrial exposure, extensive architectural-level fault simulations that required more than 350 GPU hours (using SASSIFI and NVBitFI), and detailed application-level profiling. Our main goal is to answer one of the fundamental open questions in GPU reliability evaluation: whether fault simulation provides representative results that can be used to predict the failure rates of workloads running on GPUs. We show that, in most cases, fault simulation-based prediction for silent data corruptions is sufficiently close (differences lower than 5×) to the experimentally measured rates. We also analyze the reliability of some of the main GPU functional units (including mixed-precision and tensor cores). We find that the way GPU resources are instantiated plays a critical role in the overall system reliability and that faults outside the functional units generate most detectable errors.

Artificial neural networks and artificial intelligence networks model based on structure and functions of human biological neural networks are gearing up to have a huge impact on business processes everywhere. As a matter of fact a lot of companies nowadays are already using similar technics of neural networking technology and are creating frameworks for their implementation. For example Microsoft has deep neural network to classify malware and has recently previewed Project Brainwave, a hardware architecture that makes real-time AI calculations. This project is being tested for providing solutions for automated optical inspection system. The system will scan products on the assembly line for defects with lighting speed. Meanwhile, IBM has released a beta of its Neural Network Modeler in Watson Studio that lets developers use a visual approach to designing deep learning architectures for image, text and audio data. In fewer words this is the game changer of business processes in this new era of Artificial intelligence.

AB  - Availability of high-quality bulk and epitaxial 4H-SiC has revived the feasibility of fabrication of nuclear radiation detectors which are compact, operable at room or elevated temperature, physically rugged, and radiation hard. SiC detectors have been demonstrated as excellent alpha particle detectors and hence are being considered as compact neutron detectors when coupled with neutron-alpha conversion layers. Our group at University of South Carolina has successfully demonstrated the fabrication of large area (~11 mm<sup>2</sup>) 4H-SiC epitaxial surface barrier type sensors, for detection of x-rays of energy as low as 50 eV with very high responsivity, high resolution detection of low energy gamma rays (2.1% FWHM for 59.6 keV gamma rays) and very efficient and high-resolution alpha particle detection. We have recently fabricated surface barrier detectors for alpha particles with an energy resolution of 0.29% for 5.48 MeV alpha particles, the best value reported till date, with a charge collection efficiency (CCE) ~100%. These detectors have also shown a CCE more than 57% at zero applied bias for 5.48 MeV alpha particles which opens up the possibility of highly efficient bias-less operation, a much sought-after quality for field deployment of stand-off detection system for Homeland security applications. We have performed a noise analysis in terms of equivalent noise charge and we have found that the white series noise due to the detector capacitance has substantial effect on their spectroscopic performance. We have also studied the effect of the presence of electrically active defects on detector performance using deep level transient spectroscopy measurements.

AB  - Starting from a functional description or a gate level circuit, the goal of the multi-level logic optimization is to obtain a version of the circuit that implements the original function at a lower cost. For error tolerant applications - images, video, audio, graphics, and games - it is known that errors at the outputs are tolerable provided that their severities are within application-specified thresholds. In this paper, we perform application level analysis to show that significant errors at the circuit level are tolerable. Then we develop a multi-level logic synthesis algorithm for error tolerant applications that minimizes the cost of the circuit by exploiting the budget for approximations provided by error tolerance. We use circuit area as the cost metric and use a test generation algorithm to select faults that introduce errors of low severities but provide significant area reductions. Selected faults are injected to simplify the circuit for the experiments. Results show that our approach provides significant reductions in circuit area even for modest error tolerance budgets.
